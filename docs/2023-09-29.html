                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Growth Economics Blog has moved to a new site called growthecon.com. The blog has been consolidated with the author's personal website. There is a new RSS feed for subscribers to receive posts. Email subscribers will continue to receive new posts through a MailChimp account. The author's Twitter account will still have tweets for each new post. Comments are enabled on the new site, and existing comments have been transferred over. The author will be cross-posting on both sites for a limited time. The author bought the new domain name using money received from Amazon links on the site.

                        <h1>The Declining Marginal Product of Capital</h1>
                        <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="http://growthecon.wordpress.com/?p=821" class="link" target="_blank">http://growthecon.wordpress.com/?p=821</a></p>
                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the declining marginal product of capital in the US. The author calculates the marginal product of capital (MPK) using BLS data and finds that there has been a general downward trend in the MPK since 1960. The author presents two interpretations of this trend. The first interpretation suggests that the decline in MPK is evidence of a sustained, secular change in the US economy. This interpretation is inconsistent with the assumption that the US is on a balanced growth path (BGP). The second interpretation suggests that the decline in MPK is a reversion to a long-run trend. The author compares the MPK to the earnings yield on the S&P 500 and finds that both have been declining since the 1960s. The author concludes that the explanation for the decline in MPK depends on what is considered "normal" and that the starting point of the data series is not necessarily the starting point of the economy.</p>

                        <h1>Do You Need More Money for Economic Growth to Occur?</h1>
                        <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="http://growthecon.wordpress.com/?p=795" class="link" target="_blank">http://growthecon.wordpress.com/?p=795</a></p>
                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article explains that economic growth does not necessarily require an increase in the amount of money in the economy. It clarifies the confusion between nominal and real GDP, nominal GDP and the stock of money, and absolute and relative prices. The author uses the example of an economy that produces 10 cans of Budweiser to illustrate how growth can occur through expanding production of existing products or through the addition of new products. The article emphasizes that real GDP is measured in real units, such as cans of Budweiser, and is calculated by dividing nominal GDP by a price index. The author also discusses the concept of relative prices and how they contribute to economic growth. The article concludes by stating that economic growth can occur without an increase in the amount of money in the economy, as long as there is an increase in the production of existing products or the introduction of new products. The stock of money and the level of nominal spending are irrelevant to economic growth.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the use of logarithms to analyze economic growth. The author explains that by plotting real GDP per capita in natural logs, it becomes easier to visualize and analyze the growth rates. The article provides an example of India's GDP per capita growth over time and demonstrates how to calculate the average growth rate between different periods. The author also introduces the concept of "balanced growth paths" (BGP), which are periods when the average growth rate is close to the actual growth rate. The article suggests that if different BGPs are observed, it indicates a fundamental change in the economy. The author concludes by acknowledging that while theories suggest countries will tend to end up on a BGP in the absence of major shocks, it is possible that these theories could be wrong.</p>

                        <h1>IQ and Economic Growth</h1>
                        <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="http://growthecon.wordpress.com/?p=790" class="link" target="_blank">http://growthecon.wordpress.com/?p=790</a></p>
                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the book "Hive Mind" by Garett Jones, which explores the relationship between cognitive skills (measured by IQ) and economic development. The book argues that high IQ is correlated with higher savings rates, more cooperation, market-oriented policies, the use of team-based technologies, and a tendency to conform. However, high IQ is seen as a marker rather than a cause of these behaviors and traits. The article emphasizes that cognitive skills are malleable and can be invested in, similar to investing in years of schooling. The second part of the book focuses on the returns to IQ, explaining why there is a small premium on IQ within countries but a large premium across countries. The author suggests that high-IQ countries are wealthier because they have more high-productivity, fragile production processes, which create demand for non-fragile processes and result in high average wages. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of considering these factors in the study of economic growth.</p>

Despite worries about national security and industrial decline, blocking the acquisition is unlikely to reverse the steel industry's decline. The decline is attributed to various factors, including reduced steel usage due to a shift away from manufacturing, rather than just import competition. Contrary to popular belief, the decline in U.S. steel production is not primarily due to Chinese imports, as the U.S. imports very little steel from China. The decline in U.S. steel production occurred in the 1970s, when Chinese production was minimal, and imports have not significantly replaced domestic production. Therefore, the decline in U.S. steel production is not solely due to import competition."

The article uses the Solow model to analyze China's economic growth, showing how the country's rapid capital accumulation has led to diminishing returns and overcapacity.

        "summary": "The article discusses the decline in Americans' cash holdings since 2022Q1, with the top 1% adding $200 billion to their cash holdings while others shed about $1 trillion. This has implications for excess savings and potential consumer spending. Americans' savings windfall of $2.3 trillion above pre-pandemic trends resulted in a surge in money-like assets. The latest estimates, based on the Federal Reserve's 2022Q3 release, reveal that almost all \"excess\" cash is held by households in the top 1% income bracket. This shift in cash holdings has implications for savings and borrowing patterns, with the top 1% now effectively holding the majority of \"excess\" cash. The article also highlights the incorporation of results from the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances, providing more accurate insights into household assets and liabilities."

        "published_date": "2023-12-20",
        "summarized_date": "2023-12-21",
        "summary": "The article discusses the impact of trade uncertainty on bank lending during the 2018-19 trade war. It highlights how banks reacted to the rise in trade uncertainty, with findings showing that banks exposed to trade uncertainty contracted lending to all domestic nonfinancial business borrowers. The study also reveals that the contraction in bank credit supply due to trade uncertainty may negatively impact real sector activity, particularly for bank-dependent firms. The authors, Ricardo Correa, Julian di Giovanni, Linda S. Goldberg, and Camelia Minoiu, emphasize that banks act as an amplifier of the effects of trade uncertainty, affecting a broad spectrum of firms. The study is based on a combination of firm-level information on trade uncertainty and detailed data on U.S. banks' loan exposures to domestic borrowers. The findings suggest that banks facing a rise in uncertainty adopt a wait-and-see approach by contracting credit for all borrowers, and the implications for economic activity are significant."

Kissinger played a pivotal role in the US-China d\u00e9tente of the 1970s and acted as a key \"bridge\" between Beijing and Washington. Despite criticisms of his alleged war crimes, Chinese scholars acknowledge his positive contributions to US-China relations. They contrast his approach with America's current foreign policy, praising his pragmatism and ability to view issues from a Chinese perspective. Some Chinese intellectuals express dissatisfaction with America and call for a return to Kissinger's tradition of diplomacy. However, not all Chinese intellectuals unconditionally endorse Kissinger's ideas and policies, acknowledging his disregard for smaller countries and outdated practices. The commentaries reflect the coexistence of different schools of thought in China and the complexity of Kissinger's multifaceted legacy."

The European Commission's Digital Services Act (DSA) is cited as a major threat to X, with the EC launching proceedings against the company for alleged violations. The DSA aims to enforce stringent content moderation and anti-free-speech laws, potentially leading to fines or a ban on operating in the EU. The article emphasizes the implications of these developments on free speech and the digital town square promised by Musk. It warns that if X succumbs to censorship, counternarratives will be suppressed, and free speech on social media will be severely curtailed.

It also addresses the risk of growth accidents due to rapidly slowing corporate revenue growth and the potential impact on markets. The author expresses confidence in the re-acceleration of the US economy but acknowledges the need to monitor closely for potential risks. The article concludes with insights for professional investors, discussing the impact of the Fed's rate cuts and the potential inflationary effects on asset prices."

The company's previous restructuring in 2020 did not alleviate its financial struggles, as it overestimated revenue and bottom-line forecasts. The bankruptcy filing aims to eliminate $880 million of debt and restructure with a $135 million exit plan. The plan involves a DIP-to-exit term loan and a new money exit revolver, with first lien lenders being made whole or converting their claims. Second lien lenders will equitize into 65% of the new equity, while the company will become private, and preferred and common shares will be eliminated. The debtors are represented by legal counsel and an investment banker, with support from an ad hoc group of lenders. Notably, Chick-fil-A Inc. is involved in the proceedings."

Argentina, under newly elected Javier Milei, is facing a $400 billion 'debt bomb' with $16 billion in debt payments due next year. The only real solution for \"odious debts\" in places like Argentina is either default or reforming Western-controlled institutions by changing legal frameworks or shifting alliances towards the BRICs.

Despite expectations of a recession, various factors like lower gasoline prices and government interventions helped avoid a full-blown recession, leading to significant consumer spending and economic recovery. However, consumer sentiment remains pessimistic, and there is a disconnect between economic data and public perception. The dismissal of public concerns about the economy contributes to distrust in the system and fuels speculation in markets like Bitcoin and NFTs. This has implications for the political landscape, suggesting that upcoming elections and policy decisions may not suffice to address the public's economic concerns. The article also includes a comment on traditional academic institutions being obsolete and the shift towards online education.

Analysts are trying to decipher its meaning and its implications for next year's economic focus. The phrase, along with other ambiguous statements, has led to confusion and speculation about the government's priorities, particularly regarding challenges in the real estate market, increasing local government debt, and struggling small and medium-sized city commercial banks. The article also highlights the government's emphasis on boosting economic confidence through propaganda, raising concerns about transparency and freedom of expression. The lack of clarity and openness has contributed to a decline in investor confidence, as evidenced by the stock market downturn following the conference."

Economic activity continues to rise, and financial conditions have loosened. The recent disinflation is attributed to the normalization of supply-side disruptions, but it's uncertain if current inflation readings reflect underlying economic and financial pressures. If temporary factors are suppressing recent price increases, policymakers should not assume that inflation will remain at 2% annually."

        "summary": "The High Court in Malaysia has dismissed a group of Universiti Malaya (UM) academic and administrative staff, as well as five teachers' bid to challenge the government's Covid-19 vaccination program. The court ruled that mandatory vaccination for civil servants does not violate their rights under the Federal Constitution, stating that it is necessary to ensure public health during the global pandemic. This decision has sparked controversy as it is seen as a violation of individual rights and a step towards government overreach. The applicants argued that the vaccination program was unlawful, irrational, and unconstitutional, but the court disagreed. The ruling has significant implications for civil liberties and human rights in Malaysia, as it grants the government increased power over individuals' health decisions. The decision also goes against the Nuremberg Code, which emphasizes the importance of voluntary consent and individual knowledge of the risks involved in medical experiments. The vaccine's emergency use approval and lack of public awareness about associated risks were highlighted as factors undermining informed consent. This ruling has raised concerns about Malaysia's trajectory towards a totalitarian state."

The network aimed to enhance his public image, suppress dissenting opinions, and maintain MOH narratives. It involved influencers, cultivation of journalists, hackers, troll farms, and covert operatives within social media offices. The operation received significant funding from big pharma and was used to attack critics and manipulate social media. It also downplayed the risks of Covid-19 vaccines, potentially contributing to premature deaths. Efforts are underway to dismantle the operation and bring it under the direct control of the ministry. The article raises concerns about the impact of this clandestine network on public health and free speech."

Since the Pakatan Harapan party came to power, there has been a significant increase in content removal requests, particularly targeting online scams, illegal sales, gambling, misinformation, and hate speech. The MCMC has seen a 24-fold increase in social media requests this year, resulting in the restriction of thousands of pages and posts on Meta's platforms. The article also highlights the outsourcing of content moderation to private companies, with concerns raised about bias in censoring content detrimental to Pakatan Harapan. Additionally, it criticizes the lack of transparency and potential illegality in the censorship process, likening it to the actions of informers in East Germany.

However, natural disasters, particularly hurricanes, pose a concern, as the company has a high concentration of sites in Florida. Equity Lifestyle faces competition from Sun Communities, which has been more acquisitive in recent years. International expansion is an option, but the company's focus remains on the US market due to limited benefits from expanding internationally."

While the summit has contributed to a more relaxed atmosphere, underlying issues persist. China stands to gain economically from the outcomes, with potential benefits including a revival of foreign investment and economic activity. To stimulate economic growth, China is considering a \"holy trinity\" of policy measures, including higher fiscal and budget deficit, lower yields, and a stable Chinese Yuan. The Chinese government is increasingly significant in stimulating the economy through increased borrowing and financing. However, there are concerns about local government debt, government revenues, and balance of foreign-related receipts. The article also covers China's bond yields, the Shanghai Banks Index, Ping An, and household loans, highlighting implications and takeaways such as the challenges of replacing GDP loss and the strategy for unwinding real estate leverage. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive analysis of the economic and geopolitical implications of the Xi-Biden summit and China's economic situation."

This shift is evident in Russia's annexation of Crimea and China's incremental land grabs. The author argues for the U.S. to prioritize territorial integrity as a guiding principle in the face of Cold War 2, emphasizing its potential to rally allies and distinguish American values from those of Russia and China. The article dismisses liberal interventionism and indigenism as flawed alternatives, advocating for a U.S. foreign policy centered on helping countries defend themselves against powerful neighbors. The U.S. is urged to support territorial integrity through military assistance, diplomacy, and a stance against conquests, positioning itself as a defender of the weak and a spoiler of empires. While acknowledging territorial integrity's imperfections, the author contends that it offers a better solution than other principles."

He won the presidency with unconventional campaign tactics and aims to switch to the U.S. dollar, legalize organ sales, and address economic hardships. Argentina faces severe economic challenges, including high inflation, poverty rates, and capital flight. The central bank's extensive purchase of government bonds to compensate for capital flight and monetize the budget deficit is unsustainable. The government's borrowing appears low, but the central bank's large-scale bond purchases indicate a different reality. The majority of these bonds are denominated in hard currencies, posing significant risks. The central bank's financing of these purchases is unsustainable, and the country is likely to face debt writedowns, exchange rate depreciation, and severe budgetary tightening. The situation in Argentina is crucial not only for its citizens but also for others seeking to avoid similar economic pitfalls."

The article emphasizes that Japan's budget deficit is a symptom, not the cause, of its economic issues, and cutting it may not resolve the underlying problems. Overall, it underscores the critical role of government deficits in sustaining consumer spending and the limitations of traditional economic measures in addressing Japan's economic challenges."

China's dominance in EV production is attributed to heavy subsidies, control over the EV battery supply chain, and a surplus of unsold EVs due to a domestic economic slowdown. This influx of cheap Chinese EVs threatens Europe's automotive industry, which is a significant part of its economy. The potential loss of jobs and national security concerns, particularly in light of the Ukraine conflict, have prompted Europe to consider protecting its car industry. However, imposing tariffs alone may not be sufficient, and Europe may need to invest in production subsidies, simplify regulations, and encourage EV-related startups to compete with China effectively. The situation presents Europe with a choice: adapt to the EV shift and compete with China or face the consequences of inaction."

Munger's decision not to invest in Conwood raises questions about ethical concerns and investment criteria.

        "summary": "The government has surprised the industry by appointing a non-affiliated company, KJS-SEP Synergy (M) dn. Bhd., a subsidiary of YTL Corporation, to implement a RM3.46 billion multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system for all highways in Malaysia. This move takes toll collection power away from existing operators and gives it to the new concessionaire, which is affiliated with the World Economic Forum (WEF). This indicates increased WEF influence over Malaysian government and commerce, potentially impacting Bumiputera companies. The article also highlights the influence of WEF-affiliated companies in setting up the new Malaysian digital ID and accepting new WHO IHR amendments. This suggests Malaysia's increasing alignment with WEF interests at the expense of national control."

It highlights that transwomen experience greater shifts in sexual preferences over time on hormones compared to transmen. The study indicates that trans sexuality differs from cis sexuality even before hormone use, and while some changes occur over time, most BDSM-related preferences remain relatively stable. The data suggests that after hormone use, trans sexuality aligns more with that of cis people of their preferred gender. The article also questions whether social pressures influence these shifts, particularly for transwomen, and explores the impact of hormones on dominance, submission, consent, bondage, sadomasochism, and power dynamics. The study reveals that transwomen tend to become more interested in sadomasochism over time, while transmen show smaller shifts. The article raises questions about the reasons behind these shifts and their connection to hormone use and social influences."

This move has raised concerns among neighboring countries and the US. China's involvement in Ream marks its second overseas military base and includes the construction of a pier long enough to dock an aircraft carrier and a large drydock. The base's strategic significance is debated, with some experts questioning its practicality for China's naval power projection. Despite denials from China and Cambodia, satellite imagery and other developments suggest the potential for Ream to become a de-facto Chinese overseas naval base. This expansion is part of China's broader efforts to imprint its influence on port facilities worldwide, enabling sustained deployment of naval forces. The situation has prompted calls for regional countries to band together in response to China's maritime claims.

This shift is evident in the wake of the failure of the US-led Abraham Accords and the subsequent conflict in Palestine. China's support for the Palestinian cause has led to increased diplomatic activity and engagement with Arab states, as it aims to capitalize on Washington's failure and expand its footprint in the region. China's Belt & Road Initiative (BRI) and extensive projects in the Middle East further solidify its position. Despite criticism over its treatment of Muslims domestically, China's alignment with the Arab world serves its strategic interests. This convergence presents an opportunity for China to challenge US influence and strengthen ties with a lucrative market and key oil supplier. The recent pause in fighting in Palestine is partly attributed to China's diplomacy, further underscoring its growing role in the region."

        "summary": "The article discusses the recent four-hour summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Biden in San Francisco, marking a reset in their relationship. While the summit did not yield significant outcomes, it relieved global concerns. Both leaders expressed optimism, but the sustainability of this reset is in question due to unresolved systemic differences. The article also reflects on historical turning points in US-China relations and emphasizes the need for strategic patience and learning from past leaders. It highlights the intertwined nature of the two economies and the potential for them to be a stabilizing force for global peace and development. However, it raises concerns about China's shift towards prioritizing security over economic development and the challenges faced by the Chinese leadership in restoring economic vitality and international confidence. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for China to find a better balance between security and development, particularly as the two countries enter a period of uncertainty and hope."

        "summary": "The article discusses the increase in take-up at the Federal Reserve\u2019s Overnight Reverse Repo Facility (ON RRP) due to a reduction in the supply of U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills). Money market mutual funds (MMFs) responded to the decrease in T-bill supply by investing more at the ON RRP, leading to the overall increased take-up. The shortage of T-bills limited MMFs' investment options, making the ON RRP an attractive alternative. Regression analysis shows that a decrease in T-bill issuance led government MMFs to increase their ON RRP investment significantly more than prime MMFs. The effect is economically important, with government MMFs' ON RRP investment increasing by $750 billion relative to prime MMFs, against a total increase in ON RRP take-up of $2.2 trillion.

The article concludes by questioning the relevance of short selling in the absence of major crises and suggests potential areas for short selling within the evolving political system. The closure of Chanos' short selling business is attributed to the diminishing opportunities for crisis-driven short selling. The article also explores the potential for short selling in a market characterized by slow returns and sideways movement."

Despite the public display of preference for China, analysts believe that the Muslim nations will eventually maintain cordial relations with the US. China's strategy involves projecting a neutral stance, appealing to the Global South, and mobilizing support for its leadership of developing countries. However, some experts doubt the longevity of this alliance, citing China's internal problems with the Muslim community and ongoing territorial conflicts. The Gaza conflict has also impacted US-China competition, potentially providing China with breathing space for deeper competition with the US. Additionally, it may freeze attempts to create a new trade corridor from India to Europe, affecting Washington's infrastructure plan. Ultimately, the leaders of Muslim nations aim for peace and economic development, balancing their support for Palestinians against broader geopolitical interests."

The ruling anti-China Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate, Lai Ching-te, is facing a diminishing lead, with the KMT's Hou Yu-ih gaining support. The collapse of negotiations between the KMT and the Taiwan People\u2019s Party (TPP) has led to a shift in public sentiment, with Ko being perceived negatively due to weeks of squabbling. Academic observers and voters alike view Ko as a political troublemaker, causing a loss of support. Additionally, the KMT's vice presidential candidate, Jaw Shau-kong, known for his strong pro-China views, is using fear tactics to sway voters, warning of potential conflict and instability under continued DPP rule. These developments have the potential to significantly impact cross-strait tensions and international relations."

The LA Metro experienced a 10% increase in passengers following the closure of the Santa Monica Freeway, which was repaired in a remarkably short time. Despite ongoing efforts to expand the rail system, the Metro competes with a well-funded highway system. California's transportation budget is significantly lower than the state's highway spending, and the region lacks user fees for federal highways. The state has taken steps to discourage driving through extra fees and increased petrol taxes, leading to a decline in petrol demand and a rise in Metro ridership. The article suggests the introduction of congestion fees and user fees for driving to address the collective action problem of reducing emissions. It also discusses the potential for rapid emissions decline through strong action against existing vehicles, as seen in Europe. The article emphasizes the need for policy measures to nudge car drivers towards fewer miles driven and achieve meaningful emissions reductions."

The analysis shows that bond funds experienced persistent outflows for almost three weeks, affecting a wide cross-section of funds. The outflows were more severe for corporate bond funds compared to equity funds, and the crisis coincided with a period of rising interest rates, further impacting bond fund flows. While the outflows may not raise significant financial stability concerns in absolute terms, they could still disrupt illiquid markets.

It highlights Mexico's surge in exports and real wages due to the US-China trade war, along with the country's controlled inflation and high interest rates. In contrast, Japan's wages have only recently recovered, and the country continues to run negative interest rates and a weak yen policy, leading to a surging stock market. South Korea, like Mexico, has raised minimum wages and interest rates, resulting in a stagnant stock market. The article also speculates on potential macro changes if Japan were to enact pro-inflation policies. It suggests that such policies could lead to a strong yen, stagnant stock market, and rising yields. The author wonders if Japanese politics could surprise the world, similar to the UK's Brexit and the US's Trump presidency."

It highlights the misguided attempts to reduce Russia's energy revenue, which only backfires due to Putin's ability to raise prices. The author emphasizes the need to increase domestic energy production to flood the world with supply and effectively impact Putin's revenue. The article criticizes the lack of acknowledgment and adaptation by political elites, predicting that the conflict in Ukraine will persist without a shift in energy strategy. As the second anniversary of the war in Ukraine approaches, the article questions whether leaders have learned from past failures, expressing skepticism based on recent sanctions."

Their actions sometimes contradict their decision-making rules, such as buying only small stakes in companies or making short-term investments. Berkshire Hathaway's acquisition of McLane Company in 2003 made it a significant player in the tobacco industry, accounting for over 23% of Altria's revenue in 2022. Additionally, Charlie Munger discussed a missed opportunity with Conwood Tobacco, highlighting their conflicting rationale on tobacco investments. Despite their stance on not owning tobacco operations outright, they have invested in non-controlling stakes and companies involved in large-scale tobacco product transactions. This inconsistency underscores the difficulty in reconciling their investment decisions with the ethical implications of tobacco. The article raises questions about the ethical considerations of investing in tobacco, even for renowned investors like Buffett and Munger."

        "summary": "The article discusses the use of the New York Fed DSGE model to analyze the impact of the Federal Reserve following an average inflation targeting (AIT)-type reaction function since 2021:Q2. It compares the actual policy of keeping the federal funds rate at the zero lower bound (ZLB) until March 2022 and then raising it aggressively, with a counterfactual scenario where the Fed adhered to the AIT rule. The analysis shows that actual policy was more accommodative in 2021 and more contractionary in 2022 and beyond, leading to a positive lagged effect on GDP relative to the counterfactual. The article also examines the impact of deviations from the AIT rule on interest rates, output growth, and inflation, highlighting the expansionary effect of these deviations on economic activity. Additionally, it discusses the effect of aggressive tightening in 2022 and 2023, indicating a restrictive impact on economic activity. The analysis is based on the DSGE model simulation and emphasizes the importance of policy adherence and its impact on economic outcomes."

It delves into the implications of the interest on central bank securities and the challenges faced in servicing these liabilities. The article questions Milei's ability to address the central bank's challenges and proposes potential solutions, such as converting LELIQs into government securities or recapitalizing the central bank.

The authors use a Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) model to analyze the relationship between inflation, interest rates, and economic activity. The model forecasts a significant slowdown in 2024-25 despite the expected fall in short-term interest rates. The results suggest that economic activity has been stronger than anticipated given the path of interest rates and inflation. However, the model does not imply the need for further tightening to slow activity and reduce inflation. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their analysis and plan to explore alternative approaches in a subsequent post. The study is authored by Richard Crump, Marco Del Negro, Keshav Dogra, Pranay Gundam, Donggyu Lee, Ramya Nallamotu, and Brian Pacula from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Research and Statistics Group.

The model forecasts a significant slowdown in 2024-25 despite a projected fall in short-term interest rates. The analysis also considers the impact of interest rates on economic growth and inflation. The results suggest that the economy experienced positive demand shocks, offsetting the effects of tighter policy.

        "published_date": "2023-11-21",
        "summarized_date": "2023-11-21",
        "summary": "The article discusses the use of the New York Fed DSGE model to analyze the impact of the Federal Reserve following an average inflation targeting (AIT)-type reaction function since 2021:Q2, compared to keeping the federal funds rate at the zero lower bound (ZLB) until March 2022 and then raising it aggressively. The study simulates the economy's performance under the AIT rule, showing that actual policy was more accommodative in 2021 and more contractionary in 2022 and beyond. The counterfactual experiment indicates that deviations from the AIT rule have had a positive, expansionary effect on economic activity. The analysis also isolates the effect of aggressive tightening in 2022 and 2023, finding that it had a restrictive impact on economic activity. The study concludes that the combined effect of deviations from the AIT reaction function has been expansionary on economic activity. The article is authored by Richard Crump, Marco Del Negro, Keshav Dogra, Pranay Gundam, Donggyu Lee, Ramya Nallamotu, and Brian Pacula from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Research and Statistics Group."

        "summary": "The article analyzes the impact of hurricanes on banks in Puerto Rico, particularly focusing on Hurricane Maria in 2017. Despite the island's vulnerability and the immense destruction caused by the hurricane, the economy and banks recovered surprisingly quickly. The study compares the performance of Puerto Rico banks to a control group of U.S. banks and finds that the island's banks were resilient, with loan delinquencies and bank income rebounding within two quarters. The analysis attributes this resilience to various protections, including homeowners' insurance, federal aid, and mortgage guarantees. The study also highlights the mitigating effects of property insurance, federal mortgage insurance, and disaster assistance, emphasizing the importance of these factors in financial stability. The findings provide reassurance for financial stability and households affected by weather disasters, but caution that these mitigants may be threatened by climate change. The study is authored by members of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Supervision Group and Research and Statistics Group."

        "summary": "The article discusses Japan's stagnant GDP growth, with the economy showing no improvement over the past five years. Private domestic demand has declined, and government spending is driving GDP growth. Despite a weak yen, the trade surplus remains stagnant due to uncertainties in global business investment and the Chinese economy. Japan's economy has experienced periods of growth followed by stagnation, with real wages falling and stock prices rising. The decline in real wages has led to a decrease in total employee compensation and a drop in real consumption as a share of GDP. The Bank of Japan is unlikely to raise interest rates due to low nominal wage growth and uncertain growth prospects, keeping the yen weak. The article also promotes a forthcoming book on reviving entrepreneurship in Japan."

It emphasizes the need to view nuclear power and renewable power as complementary rather than competitive, to address the challenge of declining global power emissions. The article presents a model showing that without new nuclear, wind and solar growth alone may not be sufficient to reduce emissions, due to the rapid growth of global electricity demand. It highlights the limitations of wind and solar in meeting this demand and suggests considering alternative solutions such as geothermal power, reducing demand growth, or accelerating wind and solar deployment. The article calls for a more comprehensive approach and suggests that the US nuclear initiative, to be unveiled at COP 28, should be part of a broader framework to address the insufficiency of the current trajectory. It also raises concerns about the potential failure of the nuclear initiative and the need for the World Bank to reconsider its policy on financing new nuclear projects."

The \"donut effect\" has been observed, with cheaper suburban neighborhoods experiencing faster home price appreciation than expensive urban cores. This trend was evident even before the pandemic, indicating a long-term dynamic of fading affordability caused by housing shortage. The pandemic has interacted with the housing shortage in multiple ways, leading to shifting effects within and across metro areas. For example, in San Francisco, home prices have seen a more even spread of appreciation since the pandemic, while in Dallas, mid and high-tier neighborhoods have experienced significant price gains. The tension between within-metro and across-metro migration caused by the pandemic has uniquely impacted neighborhood-level price changes across the country."

Despite the immense destruction caused by the hurricane, the island's economy and banks recovered surprisingly quickly, attributed to various protections such as homeowners' insurance, federal aid, and mortgage guarantees. The study compares the performance of Puerto Rico banks to a control group of U.S. banks, finding that while there was a modest and short-lived deterioration in loan delinquencies and bank income after Maria, they rebounded quickly. The mitigating effects of property insurance, federal mortgage insurance, disaster assistance, and underwriting contributed to the resilience of Puerto Rico banks. The study also cautions that these mitigants may be threatened by climate change. The findings are reassuring for financial stability and households needing credit to recover from weather disasters. The authors are affiliated with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York."

The study revealed that individuals with these variants had a higher mortality rate by the age of 65 compared to those without the variants. The report from Iceland, which included data from over 58,000 people, established a link between genomic data and lifespan, identifying specific gene variants associated with reduced lifespan. The study also identified additional genes linked to various health conditions, such as kidney disease, blood clotting, and cardiomyopathy. The implications of the study highlight the potential for genome sequencing to uncover actionable variants that can significantly impact lifespan. The article raises concerns about the lack of data sharing with individuals who may unknowingly harbor medically important variants and emphasizes the need for broader access to genomic information that can be potentially lifesaving. The study's findings suggest that the cost of obtaining such information should no longer be a barrier, especially as genome sequencing becomes more affordable. The article also questions the ethical implications of withholding potentially life-altering genomic data from individuals who have undergone sequencing."

The alliance has led to differing reactions from the Blue and White camps, with some vowing not to support a unity ticket with Hou at the top. Ko's intense press conference after the decision revealed his immense pressure and emotional turmoil.

However, despite this progress, there are concerns about media freedom. The government has warned against discussing sensitive topics such as race, religion, and royalty, leading to self-censorship among news portals. Additionally, several activists and news portals addressing corruption issues have faced legal threats from corporations, resulting in self-censorship and secret agreements. Furthermore, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission has been accused of blocking various online news portals and bloggers, with the government collaborating with social media platforms to enforce censorship. The recent revocation of press passes for journalists covering the national parliament has also raised concerns about media repression. These developments indicate a return to the censorship practices of past administrations, suggesting that Malaysia's improved press freedom ranking may be short-lived."

The company's Tobacco volume decline accelerated, and it faces challenges in the NGP business. Despite an attractive valuation, the article expresses caution due to structural risks in the tobacco industry's transition to smoke-free products. IMB's prospects in NGPs are deemed uncompetitive, and the article suggests a potential miss in FY25 targets.

Anwar's parliamentary support has reached 151 MPs, but this could be unstable under certain circumstances. The potential electoral support for Pakatan Harapan (PH) and Umno is crucial. Despite efforts to portray the unity government as strong and popular, there are signs indicating otherwise. Anwar's personal popularity is questioned, and PKR has been losing voter support. Anwar's position as prime minister is attributed to the King's intervention, and the government's policies are seen as conservative, straying from secularism. The article suggests that PH may struggle to rely on its traditional support base in the next general election, and the natural government of Malaysia may lean towards a Malay-Islamic centric one in the future. The orchestrated defections from Bersatu appear to be Anwar's strategy for survival."

The study reveals that minority-owned firms in the region are disproportionately affected by natural disasters, experiencing higher rates of losses compared to white-owned firms. The data also shows that minority-owned businesses suffer larger disaster-related losses as a percentage of their total revenues. The findings suggest that existing racial disparities, such as limited access to capital and credit, exacerbate the burden of natural disasters on minority-owned businesses. The study aims to highlight the vulnerability of minority-owned small businesses to natural disasters and the challenges they face in accessing credit and climate infrastructure investment. The research is conducted by Asani Sarkar, a financial research advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

However, the author raises doubts about the study's conclusions, citing factors such as the placebo effect, the potential antidepressant effects of the anesthetic propofol, and the impact of surgery on depression. The author defends ketamine's efficacy based on personal observations and suggests that the study's design may not effectively control for confounding factors. Despite the study's limitations, the author maintains a belief in ketamine's effectiveness as an antidepressant and expresses reluctance to discontinue its use based on the observed positive effects in patients."

The surge in long-term interest rates is attributed to investors' growing concerns about the US's massive debt, leading to a change in their willingness to hold US government debt at ultra-low yields. The author warns of potential economic slowdown and recession as a result of increased credit costs, impacting highly indebted countries. The article also highlights the unsustainable nature of the state Ponzi scheme, where debt is refinanced with new debt, and the potential consequences of rising interest rates on debt sustainability. The author suggests the possibility of interest rate increases being reversed due to falling inflation and shrinking money supply, but also warns of potential interventions by central banks to control interest rates, ultimately leading to inflation. The article emphasizes the systematic decline in the purchasing power of money as a significant lesson from the interest rate shock resulting from the Ponzi scheme in the debt markets."

        "summary": "The article discusses the Malaysian Scorpene Submarine Affair, which involves the EUR 1.2 billion sale of French 'Scorp\u00e8ne' submarines to Malaysia in 2002. The sale was accompanied by dubious commissions, and the affair gained attention following the kidnap and murder of a young translator in 2006. The victim, who had worked for a key agent on the deal, was targeted when she sought her share of the commissions. The subsequent murder trial implicated members of the domestic police's special intelligence branch, with potential ties to the defense minister and future prime minister Najib Razak. Investigations in Malaysia faced political obstacles, leading to scrutiny in France, where the French shipbuilding company, DCNS, was raided in 2010. It was revealed that the company operated a chain of intermediaries to bribe Razak and the agent, Abdul Razak Baginda, in violation of anti-bribery laws. The article hints at forthcoming details and encourages subscription for updates."

The results show that inaccurately mapped areas experience lower loan acceptance rates, especially for jumbo loans. The study also considers borrower characteristics and regional factors in its analysis. While the reduction in acceptance rates is statistically significant, it is relatively small compared to the effects of applicant income or wealth. The authors conclude that banks are responsive to inaccurately mapped areas, and this behavior is consistent across the Second District and the nation.

The company cut its medium-term Adjusted EBIT growth to 5-7% and expects a slower organic growth in sales and a decline in Adjusted EBIT for H1 FY24. Despite this, the company remains confident in its long-term investment case and has a Buy rating. Other spirits companies have also reported disappointing results, but Diageo's performance is comparatively better. The profit warning was triggered by a weaker outlook in LATAM & Caribbean, and the downward revision in medium-term Adjusted EBIT growth guidance. The company expects EBIT to grow ahead of organic Net Sales over time, but FY24 growth rates are likely to be below the medium-term outlook.

The trial showed a 20% reduction in cardiovascular death, heart attack, or stroke with semaglutide. However, the absolute reduction in the primary endpoint was only 1.5 per 100 people treated, and the drug's high cost raises concerns about economic burden and access. The drug also led to a modest 8.5% body weight loss and a reduction in progression to diabetes. The lack of diversity in trial participants and the potential long-term use of the drug without an exit strategy are highlighted as concerns. The findings suggest the need for more research on the drug's benefits for lower-risk individuals and the development of safe exit strategies. The article also mentions the FDA approval of a similar drug, tirzepatide, with a slightly lower cost. Overall, while the trial demonstrates the drug's effectiveness in reducing cardiovascular events, the modest absolute benefit and economic implications raise important considerations for its widespread use.",

Firli is under investigation for allegedly blackmailing a former Minister of Agriculture involved in a corruption case, adding to a series of scandals involving KPK employees. The KPK's reputation has suffered under Firli's leadership, with other leaders and employees also facing allegations of corruption, extortion, and embezzlement. The agency's decline is evident in decreased performance indicators and public trust. The KPK's struggles are attributed to the 2019 weakening of the agency through legislative changes, leading to concerns about its independence and effectiveness in combating corruption. The situation reflects a broader issue of slow response to corruption and lack of support from stakeholders, contributing to Indonesia's declining ranking in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index.",

Employees look to businesses for reliable information and healthcare access. Businesses are considered \"trusted messengers\" due to their pandemic response and support for mental health. Public health can benefit from partnering with businesses, as they are trusted by communities. McKinsey estimates that Covid-19 caused a significant loss of workdays, impacting productivity, turnover, and burnout. Public health action, such as increasing vaccine coverage and upgrading ventilation systems, can help mitigate these issues. Businesses can start by educating employees, increasing convenience, and eliminating costs related to healthcare initiatives. Equipping businesses with tools and information is crucial for employees to make evidence-based decisions and live healthier lives.

He excels in making choices such as reinvesting in the current business, acquiring new businesses, repaying debt, paying dividends, or repurchasing outstanding shares. Analyzing R.J. Reynolds' asset allocation record from 1960-1984, it is evident that most of its cash flow went into new investments, with a focus on non-tobacco acquisitions. However, the contrast in results between tobacco and non-tobacco investments was significant, with tobacco operations yielding a 20% annual return on equity compared to 2.4% for non-tobacco. The acquisitions fell short of meeting Buffett's target rate of a 15% current return. This led Buffett to sell his RJR stock, as he had little confidence in the company's asset allocation going forward. The article also discusses the impact of RJR's diversification away from tobacco and the subsequent success of tobacco investments. The tobacco industry has since shifted its focus to \"nicotine delivery systems,\" with analysts betting on the success of new nicotine products.",

However, this deadline is approaching, and if Malaysia does not reject the amendments, they will become valid in May 2024. Zaliha's lack of understanding of the implications of the amendments raises concerns, especially regarding the financial obligations and potential strain on the health budget. The costs of agreeing to the amendments have not been calculated, and there is a call for the parliament to debate and pass these costs to avoid future financial strain.

Dermot Smurfit, the former manager, faced criticism for mismanagement and toxic culture. The company's market cap is $40 million, with equal debt and cash positions, and an annual cash burn of $15-20 million. Coolbet, acquired in 2021, is profitable and potentially worth multiples of the current market cap. The founder of Coolbet expressed dissatisfaction with GAN's management and suggested a higher value for the company. Sega Sammy, a Japanese gaming company, provided a bridge loan to GAN and expressed interest in entering the US B2B market. The article suggests that Coolbet is the most valuable asset, potentially worth $60-70 million, and the B2B segment could also attract strategic buyers. The author is optimistic about GAN's potential, particularly in salvaging Coolbet, and holds GAN shares. However, readers are advised to conduct their own due diligence before investing.",

It compares the district's carbon intensity to other U.S. regions, finding it to be considerably less reliant on fossil fuels. New York State, a significant part of the district, has low carbon intensity due to renewable energy sources. The workforce in the district's energy-intensive sectors is also relatively low. However, transitioning to a lower carbon economy may still be costly, particularly in urban areas like New York City. The article emphasizes the potential expenses involved in retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency. While the district's direct costs associated with transition are likely lower than other regions, the complexity of climate-proofing urban areas may lead to significant expenses. The article concludes by highlighting the regional heterogeneity in risk exposure across the United States and the challenges in accurately measuring such risks.

However, there is a lack of consensus on what constitutes a healthy diet. Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are a major concern, as they are addictive and lack nutritional value. The US has the highest consumption of UPFs, with nearly 60% of the adult diet consisting of these foods. The FDA has little oversight over potentially toxic ingredients in food, and there is a lack of awareness and action regarding the hazards of UPFs. Protein intake is also a key consideration, with the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) being remarkably low. Increasing protein intake, especially in older adults, can help prevent muscle loss and improve healthspan. Caloric intake is another important factor, and time-restricted eating (TRE) may be an effective strategy for weight loss and glycemic control. The future of nutrition lies in precision nutrition, where individualized diets are tailored to each person's unique genetic, metabolic, and physiological makeup. However, this field is still in its early stages and requires further research and validation.",

Beijing has accused Washington of securitizing economic ties, while China has also been pan-securitizing US-related trade and investment issues. This has led to a souring of foreign investors' sentiment towards China, with many considering it \"uninvestable.\" China must find a better balance between security and development to reassure investors and review its policies towards foreign investors. Suggestions include toning down the \"to catch a spy\" campaign, which has caused unnecessary panic, and addressing the \"lying flat\" movement that has spread to the bureaucracy, leading to inaction. China should also review its policy of exit bans, which hurt its efforts to attract foreign investment.

The rally is attributed to the belief that the Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates, leading investors to \"lock in\" higher yields of 30-year treasuries. The bond bulls are also looking at lead indicators, such as the Senior Loan Officer Survey, which shows tightening credit standards at levels typical of a recession. The article highlights that professional forecasters, for the first time in 20 years, believe bond yields are too high, indicating a shift in mentality that could lead to sustained bear markets. The author expresses faith in the Japanese bond market, which has been accurate in predicting inflation and yields for over 30 years. The Japanese bond market does not see a recession coming and attributes this to the lack of plans to cut US federal government spending and the transition to a high tariff world. Despite market participants betting on deflation, the author still believes shorting TLT makes sense. The article concludes by stating that wage inflation is a political imperative, and controlling overall inflation will require reducing credit flow.",

The author believes that the conviction demonstrates the diligence and efficiency of prosecutors in building a strong case against Bankman-Fried. The conviction has also rekindled the author's trust in reality, as they believe that the market has been driven by irrationality and disconnected from reality. The author expresses frustration at being wrong about shorting the market and highlights the lack of rational thought and reality in the market over the past two years. The author sees the Bankman-Fried trial as a beacon of reality and justice in a market that is driven by irrational factors. However, the author is cautious about the potential disappointment in the sentencing of Bankman-Fried. Despite this, the author is encouraged by the injection of reality and justice in the case. The author concludes by expressing skepticism about the market's ability to justify insane valuations and predicts that the cycle of quantitative easing and yield curve control will continue.",

Higher interest rates are putting pressure on interest rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, and only cash buyers are making large purchases. The Fed is focused on bringing down inflation and achieving a sustainable monetary policy. Financial conditions have tightened, but it is uncertain how persistent this tightening will be. Higher borrowing costs are weighing on economic activity, particularly in the housing market. There has been a change in sentiment due to geopolitical risks and a significant move in interest rates. Businesses are feeling intense pressure due to higher interest rates and tighter credit markets, leading to decreased spending and selective payment choices. The weak macro environment, influenced by persistent inflation and high interest rates, is affecting businesses globally. Small business spending is slowing, and the overall environment is expected to remain soft. The article raises the question of whether the economy is in a de facto recession.",

This is due to efficiency gains and the reduction of waste from fossil fuel combustion. Germany's GDP has grown from $1.95 trillion in 2000 to $4.07 trillion in 2022, while energy consumption has fallen from 14.3 exajoules (EJ) in 2000 to 12.3 EJ in 2022, a decline of 14%. The decline in energy consumption is not a sign of deindustrialization, as some claim, as total oil consumption has also fallen by nearly 25% in the same period. Oil remains Germany's largest source of energy consumption, accounting for 35%, but renewables now make up 20% of total energy use. As inefficient combustion is phased out, GDP will continue to grow while energy consumption decreases.",

Initially, investors bought risky assets, but later in the week, concerns about a wider conflict led to a sell-off in risky assets and a rally in safe-haven assets like gold and oil. To gauge whether the fear factor will escalate, it is important to monitor oil prices, the US 2-year note, and the yield curve. Gold may not strengthen significantly as it is now considered a near-cash alternative. If the current situation is seen as a short-term scenario, gold prices will likely reverse, long-term rates will rise, and the yield curve will steepen. Key charts to watch include US 30 and 2-year yields, US 2-30 and 2-10 yield curves, Germany and UK 30-year yields, US equity indices, WTI and Brent crude oil, and spot gold.

The report highlights the importance of monitoring the vulnerabilities of the banking system, especially in light of the bank failures that occurred in March 2023. The report introduces four analytical models that measure different aspects of the banking system's vulnerability. These models include the Capital Vulnerability Index, the Fire-Sale Vulnerability Index, the Liquidity Stress Ratio, and the Run Vulnerability Index. The report discusses changes made to the methodology based on lessons learned from the March 2023 bank failures and assesses how the system-level vulnerability has evolved. The report also notes that the banking sector is vulnerable to a sudden rise in interest rates, which can lead to losses in banks' securities portfolios and weakened capital levels. However, the report concludes that systemic vulnerability remains below the levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis.",

However, current trends suggest that the claimed improvements in net interest expenses for corporations are likely based on inaccurate data, with the largest companies beginning to feel the pressure of rising interest rates and very few companies benefitting from higher rates. Smaller businesses initially benefited from stimulus, but their margins are normalizing and turning lower, in contrast to the largest companies.

In Thailand, Thai nationals are being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas, posing a test for the Thai government. Thai leaders are negotiating with Hamas to release and repatriate the hostages, with the Rafah border crossing being considered as the likely exit. The hostage-taking has put Thailand on the side of Israel in the conflict, drawing online attacks against those who sympathize with Palestinian civilians. Despite the dangers of war, many Thai migrant workers in Israel are unwilling to return to Thailand due to the higher earning potential.",

Only 1% of day traders reliably generated a positive return two years in a row, compared to 13% of regular gamblers. Holding a concentrated stock position requires an average annualized alpha of 13% over the index to be worth the additional risk. However, the performance of most stocks is not as exceptional as those like Amazon, Google, and Tesla. The risk of capital destruction is high for concentrated stock positions, and the benefit of liquidating such positions outweighs the tax burden. Day trading is even riskier, with less than 1% of day traders able to generate a profit the following year. However, the top 0.1% of traders based on skill can earn strong returns. The persistence of active management performance was also analyzed, and it was found that outperformance in the first five years did not predict outperformance in subsequent years.

Despite having more wealth, convenience, and technology than ever before, people still struggle with anxiety, depression, loneliness, addiction, and suicide. The author argues that external abundance does not lead to happiness and that people are mistaken about what makes for a good life. The Harvard Study of Adult Development, which tracked the lives of several hundred people since 1938, found that good relationships are the key to a happy life. However, society often prioritizes money, achievements, and status over relationships. The author suggests that investing in warm relationships requires time, vulnerability, effort, and energy, which are not immediately tangible or profitable. The good life cannot be bought; it must be earned. The article concludes that enduring happiness is a process, not a destination, and requires commitment, action, and the courage to be different.",

First, there is a decrease in public market liquidity, which could lead to more volatility and less liquidity in public markets. Second, banks are being marginalized due to tighter regulatory capital requirements, leading to the emergence of new financial products previously only found on bank balance sheets. Lastly, there is concern about the concentration caused by indexation, with just ten stocks making up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 index. Apollo positions itself as a beneficiary of these changes, with the ability to take advantage of market dislocations.

        "summary": "Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has announced that he will step down by November 2024, ending speculation over the country's political succession. He will pass the baton to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Lawrence Wong. The choice of Wong as the next premier was not clear-cut, as original plans to hand over power to then-Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat fell through. Wong won the contest to be Singapore's fourth premier in April 2022. However, it remains to be seen if his selection will be a smooth transition in terms of popular voter appeal, as his flagship policy of raising Singapore's Goods and Services Tax (GST) has faced criticism. Wong will have to politically own the GST tax rise and its potential consequences on the ruling People's Action Party's political fortunes. Opinion polls suggest that Wong may struggle to convince voters that he and his leadership team have what it takes to lead the country.",

The banking system and Chinese consumers will bear the brunt of the situation, but the effects will be felt worldwide. The decline in Chinese demand for industrial commodities will also affect countries like Australia and Brazil that benefited from China's growth. However, selective deglobalization and infrastructure upgrades in countries like India may offset some of the decline. China's tech sector, which was once a bright spot, has been cracked down on by President Xi, reducing its competitiveness. The slowing economy, bad debt, and broken banking system increase the risk of social instability in China. Conducting business in China is becoming more dangerous, with restrictions on capital and foreign employees leaving the country. China's troubling demographics, including a gender imbalance and an aging workforce, also pose challenges. China's growing navy and the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan are important geopolitical risks.",

However, the tech industry, particularly venture-funded startups, has been struggling since the end of 2021, leading some to believe in a \"rolling recession.\" The article explores why the tech bust did not drag the entire U.S. economy into a recession, citing macroeconomic models that explain how shocks in individual industries can propagate throughout the economy. The author acknowledges that there are various macro models with different assumptions, making it difficult to empirically test their validity. The article then delves into the details of the tech bust of 2022-23, which was triggered by investors realizing that interest rates would increase. This realization negatively impacted stock prices and affected industries such as consumer internet, SaaS, fintech, and crypto. Despite the tech bust, the U.S. economy as a whole did not experience significant negative consequences.",

The article suggests that population aging may be a contributing factor to the lack of widespread conflict in the region. Studies have shown a correlation between youthful population bulges and elevated risk of conflict. Countries with a younger population are more susceptible to political violence, revolutions, and civil conflict. The theory suggests that resource scarcity, lack of economic and social opportunities, and a surplus of young men contribute to instability and violence. However, the Middle East is steadily getting older, with countries like Iran experiencing a shift in demographics. Falling fertility rates have taken the edge off the youth bulge, making war less likely. While there are still war-torn countries with young populations, the overall trend towards an aging society in the Middle East is seen as a positive development.",

The main challenge now is to calibrate policy to sustain the positive momentum. Market prices suggest that short-term interest rates should be lowered to achieve this. However, there is a possibility that the risk goes the other way, as data shows that policy has not been restrictive this year. The strong growth momentum may require interest rates to stay the same or even increase to prevent excessive borrowing and spending. Despite a deceleration in the rate of price increases, the growth rate of spending and incomes has slowed by a smaller margin, resulting in a significant acceleration in Americans' living standards. While it would be desirable to sustain this combination of moderate inflation and strong growth, it may not be consistent with 2% yearly inflation over time. The article explores the potential risks of financial and real constraints that could slow down nominal spending and growth. However, it is unclear why nominal growth would slow, as American workers' wage income continues to grow in line with their spending.",

The critic, Siti Kasim, is a prominent human rights lawyer and activist who survived the assassination attempt. Anwar's silence on the threat against her life exposes his vanity and ego. The police also failed to properly investigate the incident.

Rafizi's relationship with Anwar Ibrahim and his daughter Nurul Izzah Anwar has deteriorated, leaving him isolated in the cabinet.

As a result, many investors are considering locking their capital in guaranteed investment certificates (GICs) that offer attractive interest rates. However, the author argues against this strategy, stating that it is not a good long-term approach. GICs do not offer any upside potential when the market recovers, and dividends are taxed more favorably than interest. The author suggests that investing in dividend stocks is a better option, as they have a history of increasing payouts and offer the potential for capital appreciation. Additionally, the author believes that high-yield savings accounts provide a more flexible alternative to GICs, offering comparable interest rates without the commitment of locking up capital. Ultimately, the decision to invest in GICs or dividend stocks depends on individual risk tolerance and investment goals.",

        "summary": "The United States Treasury has released its latest Quarterly Refunding Announcement (QRA), outlining its debt issuance plans for the coming quarters. The announcement received attention due to concerns about the size and composition of new issuance and its impact on long-term U.S. Treasury yields. However, the Treasury's announcement revealed a lower borrowing need for the current quarter and a smaller increase in coupon auction size than expected. The majority of new debt issuance will come in the form of short-term Treasury bills. The Treasury's decision to focus on short-term debt issuance is aimed at avoiding exacerbating the sell-off in long-term Treasuries and taking advantage of expected interest rate declines in the near term. Additionally, this bill-heavy issuance draws on funds from the Reverse Repo Facility (RRP), putting \"dead money\" back into private market circulation.",

However, ON still expects to grow SiC revenue and believes the weakness is temporary. The article also highlights the ramp-up of SiC production by Chinese companies and suggests that Western OEMs may be underestimating China's ability to ramp up SiC. The article concludes by discussing the diverging aspects of SiC demand in the solar industry and the potential impact on ON. Overall, the article suggests that while there may be short-term challenges in the SiC market, the long-term outlook remains positive."

Buffett himself is known for his integrity and has remarkably few enemies despite his vast wealth. However, a recent lawsuit filed by the Haslam family against Berkshire Hathaway alleges unfair treatment in the valuation of their remaining stake in Pilot. The lawsuit raises concerns about future capital deployment opportunities for Berkshire. The lawsuit comes after a joint press release in 2017 announced Berkshire's initial investment in Pilot. The terms of the agreement included Berkshire acquiring a 38.6% stake in Pilot and the Haslam family retaining a 20% stake. The lawsuit claims that Berkshire undervalued Pilot, resulting in the Haslam family receiving less than they were entitled to. The outcome of the lawsuit could have implications for Berkshire's reputation and future business dealings."

The founders are skeptical that Berkshire Hathaway violated the terms of the agreement. In other news, the fixed rate for newly issued I Bonds has increased to 1.3% as of November 1. I Bonds also pay additional interest tied to the inflation rate. The current semi-annual inflation adjustment is 1.97%, resulting in a total composite rate of 5.27% for I Bonds issued between November 2023 and April 2024. The fixed rate of 1.3% is the highest offered since 2007. Comparatively, the real yield on five-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) is 2.31%. I Bonds have an annual purchase limit of $10,000 and taxes can be deferred until redemption. TIPS, on the other hand, pay taxable interest semi-annually."

This decision is seen as a step towards a structurally higher inflation world. The Treasury's move to prioritize short-term debt, known as bills, over long-term bonds, known as coupons, is a response to the lack of demand for long-duration bonds. By reducing coupon supply and increasing bill issuance, the Treasury can overlook private sector inflation concerns in its funding. However, this decision is likely to contribute to entrenching inflation further and ultimately lead to higher long-term rates. In the near term, the loosened financial conditions resulting from this policy choice are expected to stimulate risk assets. The author suggests buying the Russell 2000 index as a trade until inflation concerns likely come back."

The IPEF, launched by the US in 2022, is struggling due to the absence of major economies like China and Japan, which are part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The IPEF aims to promote economic cooperation and development in the Indo-Pacific region, but without the participation of key players, its effectiveness is limited. The article argues that the US should reconsider its stance on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and rejoin the trade pact to strengthen its position in the Indo-Pacific region and counter China's influence. The absence of the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership has allowed China to expand its economic influence in the region through initiatives like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

The switch has caused confusion and concern, as Biobot's graphs were widely used and easily understood by the public. While the switch is not expected to create a significant data lag, it has led to a reduction in reporting frequency and a decrease in coverage. The CDC's website is considered the most comprehensive source of data, but its dashboard is difficult to navigate. The switch is currently being contested by Biobot, resulting in a stop work order for Verily. The impact of the switch on public health surveillance during the respiratory season remains uncertain. It is recommended that individuals stay informed by visiting alternative sources for data, such as the CDC website, and be aware of the reduced coverage and reporting frequency of Biobot's data."

Despite ongoing losses in the FRL segment, Meta is expected to report record non-GAAP EPS in FY23. Overall, Meta's financial performance and user base growth indicate a positive outlook for the company."

        "summary": "The Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee upgraded its assessment of US economic growth, with activity now seen as expanding at a \"strong\" pace. This follows the release of the Q3 GDP print, which showed America's real output growing at a 4.9% annualized rate, the fastest pace since the beginning of the Fed's tightening cycle in early 2022. Cumulative real GDP growth over the last year is now at 2.9%, returning to levels more in line with the high growth years of the 2010s. Even if GDP were to shrink in Q4, it would still match the median FOMC participants' growth projections. Nominal economic output also saw growth, with a year-on-year increase of 6.3%. Wage growth in the Employment Cost Index suggests that nominal gross labor income was stronger than previously thought. The combination of strong demand-side growth and easing supply-side constraints is allowing the US to experience strong real economic growth."

        "summary": "Fadhlina Sidek, the current Minister of Education in Malaysia, is facing criticism for her lack of experience and competence in the field. She was appointed as a minister due to her loyalty to Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. However, there has been little focus on important issues such as raising the standard of STEM education and addressing teacher absenteeism. Fadhlina's decision to hold a Palestine Solidarity Week in schools has also received international criticism and caused a rift among coalition partners. Critics argue that Fadhlina is more interested in covering up institutional problems rather than finding solutions. The introduction of an Islamic module in the curriculum is seen as further Islamization of schools. Overall, Fadhlina is seen as a puppet serving her superior rather than someone passionate about her responsibilities. There are calls for an urgent change of minister in the education portfolio."

He used his control over the media and institutions to maintain his popularity and suppress opposition. Chavez was known for his marathon television appearances, where he would make impromptu decisions and announcements, often with no regard for the consequences. He would sing, dance, and perform various stunts to keep the public engaged. However, his rule was marked by mismanagement and corruption, leading to the collapse of the Venezuelan economy. Chavez's populist policies, such as land expropriation and price controls, led to shortages and economic decline. Despite his popularity, Chavez's legacy is one of missed opportunities and squandered potential. His successor, Nicolas Maduro, has continued his authoritarian rule, suspending elections and further suppressing dissent. The Venezuelan people continue to suffer under the weight of a failed state and a crumbling economy."

The company's profit margin is in line with expectations for its low-margin, high-volume industry. JD's shares outstanding have increased due to using shares as currency for growth, but the company has since announced a share repurchase program. JD's business segments include JD Retail, JD Logistics, JD Health, JD Property, JD Industrials, and JD New Business. The management, led by founder Richard Liu, has experience and has shown good capital allocation skills, reinvesting in the business, buying back shares, and paying dividends. The bull case for JD includes the end of the tech crackdown and the company's low valuation, while the bear case includes the risk of delisting, slower revenue growth, and increased competition. Based on valuation metrics and a discounted cash flow model, JD is considered undervalued, with a buy price of $39.79 compared to the current stock price of $25.65."

It highlights the enormous future demand for copper due to the electrification of the world economy, which is metals-intensive and requires vast amounts of copper. The article also mentions the factors contributing to a global copper shortage, including under-investment, depletion of existing mines, long lead times for new mines, financing difficulties, obstructive regulations, and a labor/skills shortage. These factors pose significant obstacles to achieving decarbonization and the energy transition. The article suggests that the energy transition may not happen as policymakers expect or intend due to these supply-side constraints. As a result, the article explores investment opportunities in the auto sector, particularly in companies involved in catalytic converters and platinum group metals, which have a role in achieving net zero targets.

Similarly, in Germany, the Green Party, with just 16% of seats, has focused on destroying the country's energy sector, particularly nuclear power. Germany has shut down all its nuclear reactors, despite other countries relying on nuclear energy to replace fossil fuels. The Green Party now faces the consequences of their decision as winter approaches and the country grapples with how to power itself.

        "summary": "Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, discusses the lack of open debate surrounding Covid-19 vaccine policies. He highlights two examples: the promotion of ineffective booster vaccines and the recommendation of boosters for everyone, rather than just high-risk groups. Offit argues that officials are not being honest about the potential side effects of the vaccines, such as myocarditis and pericarditis in young males. He suggests that officials would lie to parents to convince them to vaccinate their children, even if the disease is harmless to them. Offit also criticizes the lack of nuanced messaging, where officials fail to differentiate between who should and should not receive the vaccine. The article suggests that scientists should be allowed to tell the truth and engage in open debate, as truth has been under attack during the Covid-19 pandemic."

        "summary": "The US is facing a potential permanent shift in its ties with the Middle East as countries in the region downgrade their relations with Washington and expand ties with China and Russia. The recent conflict between Israel and Gaza has further exacerbated this trend, with major Middle Eastern states opposing the US and supporting Russia's call for a ceasefire. The UAE, a signatory of the Abraham Accords, has also opposed the US resolution in the United Nations Security Council and voted in favor of the Russian resolution. Arab states have criticized the US and Israel for violating international law and using the right to self-defense as a pretext for collective punishment. The failure of the US to influence the Middle East in favor of Israel presents an opportunity for China and Russia to expand their influence in the region. The US will need to navigate this growing divide and rebuild its ties in order to counter the rising influence of China and Russia, which remains its most important national security interest."

        "summary": "The growing demand for rare metals used in renewable energy is causing a shake-up in the economics and geopolitics of the energy world. China, which dominates the processing capacity for these metals, is considering restricting exports, leading governments to seek alternative sources. Indonesia, the world's largest producer of nickel, has already banned exports of raw nickel and attracted foreign investment in nickel processing. However, the EU has challenged Indonesia's export controls at the World Trade Organization. In the technology industry in China, there is a cultural emphasis on being data-driven and user-driven, with decisions based on data feedback and user research. India, despite its massive population, is still a relatively poor country, but it has the potential to mobilize resources for limited projects. The race to deploy AI-powered submarines is seen as crucial for maintaining the balance of power globally, with the United States concerned about the Chinese Communist Party becoming the dominant power. In Hong Kong, the mastery of public relations and strategy in Singapore is admired, while Japan's efforts to block out the sun are noted. The streets of Beijing show progress, but many improvised cafes and galleries have been cleared away. A coffee brand in Vietnam emphasizes the importance of storytelling to add value to a product. The book \"The Alchemist\" is praised for its impact on the reader's life, while \"Invention: A Life\" by James Dyson is criticized for being self-serving. The biography of Elon Musk is recommended, and the author shares updates on their golf gear venture. The email concludes with a reminder to make the most of the limited time we have."

        "summary": "The United States needs to prioritize its focus on Asia rather than the Middle East. Asia is a strategically important region with developed countries that want to maintain their wealth and freedom, as well as developing countries that are experiencing significant growth. China's aggressive behavior poses a threat to the region, and the US is seen as indispensable in deterring Chinese power. On the other hand, the Middle East is trapped in a cycle of conflict and needs reform on various levels. However, US power cannot accomplish this and has often led to negative consequences, such as the Iraq War. Additionally, the Middle East is not economically important to the US, while Asia is a crucial trading partner. The US should maintain a light presence in the Middle East, intervening only in extreme cases, while focusing on strengthening its defensive power and engagement in Asia. This includes supplying defensive weapons to allies, re-engaging economically, and building strong alliances in the region. Despite emotional conflicts in the Middle East, the US must maintain discipline and prioritize its attention on Asia."

The author discusses the performance of their recommendations, stating that their average return is 2.8% across 77 recommendations. They also highlight the success of their short ideas, which have generated an average return of 10%. On the long side, the average return is essentially zero. The author then discusses two specific investment ideas. The first is a short case for Expeditors International of Washington (EXPD), which hasn't worked out yet but may have downside potential due to competition and the potential for a U.S. recession. The second idea is a restaurant operator called Portillo's (PTLO), which the author believes is still a good long-term investment despite the stock price decline. The article also briefly mentions the third quarter earnings report of Orion Group Holdings (ORN), which the author sees as a positive step in the right direction. Overall, the author maintains a broad perspective on their investment ideas and continues to work on improving their idea generation."

Foreign intelligence agencies are known to carry out espionage operations and set up honey-traps to collect evidence that could be used for political blackmail or bribery. China, Russia, the United States, and countries within the MENA region are particularly eager to compromise foreign dignitaries. This highlights the importance of Malaysian dignitaries being cautious and avoiding compromising situations while overseas, even within their hotel suites. The materials collected through espionage could be used to undermine the Malaysian government or passed on to local political groups. It is crucial for national leaders to be aware of the possibility of espionage when they are abroad."

She offers witchcraft, ritual, tarot, mythology, ecology, embodiment, belonging, animism, and enchantment for art witches with ADHD. Her content strategy includes publishing twice a week and offering essays, monthly live full-moon rituals, a monthly downloadable Witch Guide, live chats, a reading group, and surprise gifts. She finds Substack appealing because it allows her to go in-depth about witchcraft, unlike social media platforms where she feels like a carnival barker. She offers moon rituals as a subscription, which saves her time on marketing. Since joining Substack, she has experienced significant growth, with 13,000 subscribers and 430 paid subscribers. She plans to bring more of her followers from other social media platforms to Substack. Her advice for new writers is to focus on what makes them unique and consider what their readers need. She believes that artists deserve to be paid and that their success benefits everyone. She finds inspiration from other Substack writers, such as Paul Jarvis."

Subprime delinquencies are nearing levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis, indicating that consumers are in worse shape than expected. Geopolitical tensions, such as the crisis in Ukraine-Russia and the events in the Middle East, are causing concern and could impact consumer spending. In the tech sector, companies like Snap and Meta have seen some customers pull back on ad spending due to geopolitical risks. However, cloud spending remains strong, with companies moving their data storage needs online. In the automotive industry, Ford and General Motors have reported lower-than-expected demand for electric vehicles, which could disrupt supply chains. Defense contractors are experiencing a sharp rise in demand for defense spending due to heightened geopolitical risks."

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is mutating faster than other viruses, with two specific subvariants, HV.1 and JN.1, gaining attention. The flu remains at low levels with no significant movement in hospitalizations or pediatric deaths. However, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is exponentially increasing, although it is predicted to be lower than last season due to immunity from the previous year.

        "summary": "EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is a widely-used metric in the investment community, but it is also controversial because it excludes certain costs. Critics argue that EBITDA makes profits look better by excluding real expenses such as interest, taxes, and stock-based compensation. However, there are industries and profiles in which EBITDA is more useful, such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) and the resorts and casinos sector. EBITDA is commonly used to judge a company's creditworthiness and to understand the valuation of the entire business. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes even more expenses, has become popular, particularly among unprofitable tech companies. However, the use of adjusted figures has been criticized for inflating performance and misleading investors. The case of WeWork's \"Community Adjusted EBITDA\" metric, which excluded various expenses, highlighted the absurdity of some adjusted figures. Despite the criticisms, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA can still provide valuable information, but investors need to remain flexible and consider other metrics as well."

        "summary": "Anwar Ibrahim's Madani government in Malaysia is facing internal cracks and growing dissatisfaction from supporters. The Sarawak government publicly rejected two decisions made by Anwar's administration, indicating a lack of consultation and insensitivity towards coalition partners. Additionally, the DAP leader broke cabinet solidarity over the Palestine Solidarity Week issue, further rebuking the prime minister. Dissatisfaction within Anwar's own party, PKR, is also evident. The potential pardon of former prime minister Najib Razak could strain the unity coalition even further. Calls for Anwar to step down are growing as the government fails to address pressing issues such as the rising cost of living and favoritism towards GLCs. A realignment of political power is possible, with Perikatan Nasional potentially gaining a majority in parliament if UMNO abandons PH and GPS joins their coalition. The DAP joining the coalition would solidify PN's government and potentially lead to a more politically stable Malaysia. The future of Anwar's government and the possibility of a new prime minister are uncertain."

        "summary": "Manifest, the first conference for prediction market enthusiasts, was recently held in Berkeley. One of the highlights of the conference was the discussion around the regulatory challenges faced by prediction markets, particularly in relation to election betting. The main government regulator, the CFTC, denied Kalshi's petition to have betting markets on elections, which has discouraged the prediction market community. The concern from regulators is that election fraud could indirectly become a type of financial fraud, creating a problem for the CFTC. Despite this setback, prediction market enthusiasts remain hopeful that prediction markets can become a load-bearing piece of social technology. One suggestion is to focus on the niche of hiring, creating a product that companies can use to predict employee performance. Another challenge for prediction markets is their limited use in journalism, as editors tend to prefer interacting with official institutions rather than prediction market experts. In terms of new developments, Manifold has launched a prediction market dating site called manifold.love, where users can suggest matches and bet on the chance of a successful relationship lasting at least six months. Additionally, prediction markets have been used to gain clarity on controversial news issues, such as the recent bombing of a hospital in Gaza."

It highlights the potential for the Biden administration to address Iran's oil exports, which are currently over sanction limits. The article then explores the disconnect between strong economic growth (4-5% in Q3) and the cracking stock market. It suggests that the stock market's recent struggles may be due to too much economic growth, leading to upward pressure on long-term interest rates and making the Fed less likely to cut interest rates. The article concludes by expressing skepticism about the strength of the economy, citing earnings reports that appear to be quasi-recessionary."

The key is to identify the gap between price and value and determine if there is a significant mispricing. The author uses the example of Intel's stock price only declining slightly after NVIDIA's announcement, suggesting that the market may have already priced in the news or that Intel's stock was already undervalued. The article emphasizes the importance of considering both price and fundamental value when evaluating investments. It also mentions the concept of asymmetric risk-reward, where investing in undervalued stocks with low multiples can provide both downside protection and upside potential. The author concludes by mentioning that in the upcoming Part 2 report, they will delve into the future of Intel and address concerns surrounding the company."

The report highlights the growth of the global semiconductor industry and the high barriers to entry in the leading-edge fabs market. It suggests that Intel IFS alone could justify Intel's entire valuation. The report draws an analogy to Warren Buffett's acquisition of Apple in 2016, stating that Intel could be in a similar position of maximum pessimism. The article also mentions a mindblowing observation about TSMC's business economics, where its CAPEX can be used to predict future revenues. Overall, the report emphasizes the potential of Intel IFS and its role in Intel's future growth."

However, the program has been stalled by the military and the elites. The party's proposal to distribute digital money to every Thai citizen has been met with resistance from the old guard forces. The coalition government, led by real estate magnate Srettha Thavasin, has struggled to implement its campaign promises due to opposition from the business and finance sectors. The government has had to surrender key ministries to its coalition partners, leaving Pheu Thai with limited influence. The once-dominant Move Forward Party has been sidelined. The need to revive the economy is growing critical after years of mismanagement. The policy paper outlined an ambitious plan to address debt, reduce energy costs, promote renewable energy, improve infrastructure, and resolve differences regarding the constitution. However, there is uncertainty about whether these plans will be implemented. The political turbulence in Thailand may affect foreign investors and trade partners."

Meanwhile, Colombia's leftist president, Gustavo Petro, has suffered a blow in local elections due to a lack of cross-party support for his plans to overhaul health, pension, and labor laws, as well as scandals involving his government and family. In other news, China Airlines frequent flyer miles are being used up by travelers to fly to Tokyo, with layovers in Taiwan due to a lack of redemption seats for Osaka. The travelers plan to visit temples and gardens in Kyoto and will provide trip reports focused on stocks encountered during their travels."

        "summary": "Takahashi Korekiyo, a Japanese politician and bureaucrat, is often referred to as the \"Japanese Keynes\" for his adoption of Keynesian policies before John Maynard Keynes published his famous book. Takahashi served as the 20th Prime Minister of Japan and later as the Finance Minister during the Showa Depression of 1929-1932. He implemented a three-pillar strategy to revive the Japanese economy, which included currency depreciation, fiscal stimulus, and monetary expansion. Takahashi's policies were successful in ending the deflationary trend and restoring economic growth in Japan. He allowed the yen to depreciate, increased fiscal expenditures, and monetized the fiscal deficit by having the Bank of Japan buy government bonds. However, there is debate over which policy tool was the most effective in Japan's recovery. Some argue that the depreciation of the yen and changes in inflation expectations played a significant role, while others emphasize the role of fiscal expansion and the shift to a system of bureaucratic and military control. Despite the success of his policies, Takahashi was assassinated in 1936, leading to a loss of fiscal discipline and the transition to a wartime command economy."

Despite positive economic indicators such as rising wages, wealth, and job opportunities, there is a gap between perceptions and the data. The article suggests that one possible explanation for the gloom is the fear of inflation and its potential impact on wages. It also highlights the impact of long-term interest rates and the rising prices of goods and services that Americans don't experience on a daily basis. The article argues against the idea that Americans have been duped by the media into thinking the economy is bad when it is actually good. It also mentions the affordability of gasoline and its effect on economic sentiment. The article concludes by stating that higher gasoline prices are beneficial for the climate and energy transition. It downplays the significance of oil as a platform for economic growth and emphasizes the importance of electricity."

The new interim CEO has made significant open market purchases, indicating a change in management. The company's valuation is below its historical levels, mainly due to the previous mismanagement. Wiley is also selling businesses with a book value of $315 million and annualized sales of over $300 million, which accounts for more than 13% of its enterprise value. The stock has underperformed the market since 1989, but the fundamentals of the business are stable. The outgoing CEO made costly acquisitions that are now contributing nothing to the bottom line. Despite a projected 35% decline in earnings in FY24, the valuation of the stock remains cheap. Asset sales could potentially help improve the company's financial situation. Private equity firms have shown interest in the industry, indicating potential value in Wiley. FY24 is expected to be a challenging year, but it could also mark a trough in earnings, making Wiley an interesting stock to follow."

Anwar has taken a neutral position between the two superpowers, but his advocacy for the Palestinian people has faced criticism. He recently revealed that he was threatened by certain Western powers for his outspokenness. Anwar's declaration of \"Palestinian Solidarity Week\" in schools has also been met with opposition. Despite his close relationships with leaders across the world, Malaysia's long-held anti-Israel position has prevented Anwar from playing a role in bringing peace to the region. Instead, his recent MENA trip resulted in a commitment to support Saudi Arabia's bid for the 2034 World Cup. Malaysia's stance on the conflict has attracted international attention and raised concerns about its support for terrorism. The article suggests that if Malaysian foreign policy had been more relevant, Anwar could have played a major role in resolving the crisis."

The review, led by former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, aims to strengthen the Bank's processes in support of its forward-looking approach to monetary policy. The article highlights concerns with the Bank's inflation forecasts, noting serial correlation in forecast errors and the failure to reflect on potential structural breaks in the inflation process. It also questions the role of money aggregates in forecasting inflation and the weight placed on international developments in the Bank's inflation forecasts. The article argues that the Bank has de facto stopped targeting inflation forecasts and instead sets policy in reaction to its own forecast errors, allowing the market to lead the policy process. The author suggests that the Bank should return focus to the inflation forecast and lead the market again."

        "summary": "A study analyzing return data for American stocks, bonds, and real estate equity from 1890-2022 found that real estate outperformed stocks and bonds on a risk-adjusted basis. Real estate investors saw an average annual return of 10% with 8% volatility, compared to 5% return with 6% volatility for bondholders and 11% return with 18% volatility for stock investors. Diversifying across all three asset classes significantly boosted risk-adjusted returns. A portfolio with 45% real estate, 45% bonds, and 10% stocks had a higher risk-adjusted return than any individual asset class. The study also emphasized the importance of including real estate in a portfolio, as it provides stock-like upside with bond-like downside. The article suggests that a simple mix of real estate, stocks, and bonds would be easy to manage and likely perform well. Additionally, the article discusses the surprising wealth of a fictional character in the movie \"Trading Places\" and how a few adjustments to her portfolio could have significantly increased her net worth."

RTX also expects favorable IRS guidance to benefit its free cash flow by $0.5 billion in 2023 and $1.7 billion in the years leading up to 2026. The company maintains its commitment to reaching $7.5 billion in free cash flow by 2025.

Sentiment among active investment managers is low, and there is doubt about the market outlook. The market may follow the seasonal script of strength into year-end, but buyback announcements have been down and borrowing costs for small businesses are higher. Quality stocks are at record expensive valuations. Japanese stocks are cheap and have seen improvements in corporate governance.

Even Stripe, one of the newest entrants in the payments industry, acknowledges that there is still a lot of work to be done to solve the challenges they set out to address. The increasing complexities of the world have made it even more challenging for companies like Stripe to achieve their goals. The challenges of complexity have recently come to light with payments platform Adyen and European payments processor Worldline resetting their growth expectations lower, causing their stock prices to halve.

However, there are concerns about Blackstone's private REIT, BREIT, as liquidity is being offered to investors at a 38% discount to stated NAV. Blackstone has made deals, such as a $4 billion investment by the University of California, to prevent forced selling and maintain stable returns. Private equity firms benefit from investors paying extra fees to hide volatility and avoid mark-to-market events. They also benefit from the flow of funds into private credit, with Ares Capital being a leading firm in this space. Private equity firms also benefit from government policies, such as the use of carried interest to reduce tax bills. The author suggests that the time to short private equity may come when US politicians decide to close this tax advantage, which may be more likely if the Democrats control both houses. However, timing is crucial in short selling."

He believes that the conflict in the Middle East has been a convenient way for the government to print money. Lepard also expresses concern about the increasing federal budget deficit in the US and the lack of fiscal restraint in Washington D.C. He predicts that interest rates will rise in the long term due to inflation and a loss of confidence in bonds. Lepard believes that gold and bitcoin will continue to be safe havens as people realize that the government will continue to print money and debase the currency. He concludes by criticizing central planning and the manipulation of interest rates by policymakers, stating that it is a recipe for disaster."

This comes as no surprise to the author, who has been predicting a re-rating of tech stock valuations due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes and the inflated valuations caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. While the author believes that the market needs to decline significantly before it can rise again, a conversation with a friend introduced a bullish scenario where the market could actually move higher from here. However, the author finds this unlikely. Market sentiment is souring, and even robust earnings reports are not enough to buoy the NASDAQ. The author believes that we are on the cusp of a major credit crisis and an impending market crash, with rates rising faster than ever before. The author also raises questions about the future of bonds, yields, the U.S. dollar, bitcoin, gold, the Fed's control of the bond market, and the real estate sector."

However, the electoral prospects of Ko Wen-je, an independent candidate, are surprisingly strong. Wen-je, the current mayor of Taipei, has gained popularity due to his non-partisan approach and focus on local issues. He has been able to appeal to both DPP and KMT supporters, positioning himself as a viable alternative to the two major parties. Additionally, Wen-je's popularity has been boosted by his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been praised by the public. As the election approaches, it is becoming increasingly clear that Wen-je is a serious contender and could potentially disrupt the dominance of the DPP and KMT in Taiwanese politics."

Despite receiving financial support from the World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, as well as visionary planning from Singapore's Centre for Liveable Cities, the city has stagnated since 2019. The 33,000 farmers who gave up their lands for the construction of the capital now feel cheated. The current government, which took power in 2019, is determined to develop another city as the state capital, even though the matter is pending before India's highest court. The article also mentions the proposed decentralization of the government across the state, with Amaravati as the legislative capital, Visakhapatnam as the executive capital, and Kurnool as the judicial capital. However, this decision has faced protests from the farmers who gave up their lands for Amaravati. The article concludes by mentioning that the future of Amaravati remains uncertain, as it depends on the outcome of the upcoming assembly elections and the legal proceedings against the former chief minister, N. Chandrababu Naidu."

The increase in wealth is evenly distributed across all income levels, with those at the bottom of the distribution gaining proportionally more than those at the top. Inequality, including racial, educational, and urban-rural inequality, has decreased. Debt is also less of a problem, and there is even some surprising good news about income. The increase in wealth is attributed to rising housing prices, increased retirement account values, and falling debt. The data also shows that the value of used cars has contributed to the increase in wealth, although some question whether this should be considered true wealth. Overall, the data suggests that Americans' finances are more secure than they may perceive, despite the unrest and negative news in the country. However, the rising cost of housing may pose challenges for young people looking to buy homes and enter the system of broad-based wealth."

The author suggests that the World Bank's four-tier classification system based on income is a more useful way to categorize countries. They also highlight the importance of manufacturing in driving economic growth, with countries that export manufactured goods experiencing faster growth compared to those that rely on natural resources.

The SCF provides detailed data on household balance sheets, including information on assets such as housing, vehicles, and financial investments. The survey shows that the median US family's cash balances increased by over 45% between 2019 and 2022, and most families were able to pay down credit card debt. However, households in the bottom 40% of the income distribution have depleted their savings, and their financial position has worsened. The housing market has been a significant driver of middle-class wealth, with the median homeowner's net worth increasing by $101,000 since 2019, largely due to home price appreciation. The survey also highlights the rise in household involvement in financial markets, with 58% of families having some part of their net worth tied to the stock market."

The recent M&A activity does not indicate a greater or lesser confidence in new energies, as both traditional and new energy sources are needed to meet the world's growing energy demands. The timing of these deals is opportune, given geopolitical turmoil, potentially higher inflation, and challenging government debt burdens. The profitability of the energy sector is currently above long-term averages, and these deals are not considered \"peak of cycle\" deals. The transactions do not necessarily indicate a bullish long-term outlook for oil demand, but rather a focus on low-cost, competitive assets.

The article concludes with acknowledgments and thanks to the people who supported the author throughout the donation process."

        "summary": "The Q3-2023 GDP growth in the US was a surprising 4.9% QoQ, rebounding from subdued levels in Q2-2023. Alternative metrics suggest a more modest GDP growth in the 3.25-3.5% range. Productivity has shown a positive trend, which could help alleviate concerns of inflation. Measures of inflation expectation have normalized, and the term structure suggests the possibility of deflationary conditions. Real interest rates have spiked, making risk-free rates attractive. The article also discusses the deterioration of US state capacity and the inability to regulate collusive pricing. The rebound in GDP was driven by consumer spending, an unexpected build in private inventories, and a jump in government spending. However, net exports disappointed, indicating weak global growth. Alternate approaches suggest that the GDP growth was most likely around 3.5%."

        "summary": "Dividend investors are seeing a decline in their portfolios due to rising bond rates, but this presents a buying opportunity for those looking to lock in attractive yields. High yield stocks, particularly preferred shares, offer the potential for higher dividend safety, after-tax yields, and capital gains potential. Three preferred share opportunities worth considering are Sagen MI Canada, Brookfield Renewables, and Canaccord Genuity. Sagen MI Canada, Canada's second-largest mortgage default insurer, offers a yield of over 8% and has a robust balance sheet. Brookfield Renewables, with its contracted utility assets, is on track to generate over $1 billion in FFO in 2023 and pays a dividend to preferred shareholders. Canaccord Genuity, despite its common shares falling, has consistently profitable wealth management business and affordable preferred share dividends. The Series C preferred shares of Canaccord Genuity offer a yield of 10.4% and have the potential for a higher yield in the future. Overall, the preferred share market presents an opportunity for investors to earn attractive yields and potentially profit from the market's current sentiment."

        "summary": "The quarterly results of the top three major cloud providers - AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud - showed a divergence in market reaction. Azure and AWS were rewarded for their growth rates, while Google Cloud was punished for its slowing growth rate. The disappointment in Google Cloud's performance can be attributed to the lack of updates and a precise timeline for the release of Gemini, Google's multi-model foundational AI model. The delay in Gemini's release can be understood in the context of a corporate reorganization that occurred when Google Brain and DeepMind merged to form Google DeepMind. The reorganization has led to confusion and a lack of clear direction within the team, as well as clashes in culture and technology. Understanding the impact of reorganizations is crucial for investors in the tech industry, as it can help predict market expectations and make informed investment decisions. Despite the challenges, Gemini is expected to eventually be released with impressive multi-model capabilities, but the question remains whether it will be able to differentiate itself in a market where similar models are already being used."

        "summary": "The United States' federal deficit for the 2023 fiscal year was $1.7 trillion, but some argue that the more accurate number is $2.0 trillion after adjusting for student debt cancellation accounting. This represents a doubling of last year's effective deficit. The country's slide into structural deficits over the past twenty years is noteworthy, with a significant shift in the composition of credit growth towards the federal government. Government spending has replaced private credit expansion as an engine of growth. While there are economic benefits to socializing debt, public debt still has a cost, and as those costs compound, the country must decide how to pay for it. The total debt outstanding across all sectors is $96 trillion, with government debt accounting for 29% of all U.S. debt. The federal government has the lowest borrowing cost and nearly unlimited access to new debt, but accumulating public debt comes with a cost. The U.S. federal debt service can be paid through taxpayers, lenders, or the Federal Reserve, each with its own considerations. The path ahead requires budgetary restraint or compounding debts and gradual monetization. The question of who will bear the costs of the debt remains unanswered, but regardless of the path chosen, there will be consequences."

Rusal has reduced its exposure to the US market due to trade barriers and tariffs on Russian imports, and has shifted its sales focus from Europe to Asia. The company is also seeking to conduct more sales in non-USD currencies and diversify its funding sources. Rusal's low-cost green aluminum advantages, stable demand profile, and prudent approach make it a strong player in the industry. However, the report notes that the lack of catalysts and ongoing geopolitical tensions will likely prevent a re-rating of the company's stock. The report also suggests that Rusal bonds could offer an attractive investment opportunity in the medium term, with an AA+ rating from China Chengxin Credit Ratings."

China's efforts to exert influence abroad include economic investments through the Belt and Road Initiative, linguistic influence by promoting closer relations with non-Western countries, political influence through initiatives like the Global Development Initiative, and information influence through propaganda and censorship. China's actions have gained traction abroad, as evidenced by a report released by the U.S Department of State on China's efforts to reshape the global information environment.

The spread between BTPs and bunds has remained below 200bps, compared to a spread of 300bps in 2018. The main buyers of BTPs have been Italian households and corporates, who have shifted their investments from broad money to government securities. The European Central Bank (ECB) has also played a role in supporting BTP performance through its purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP). However, the ECB's purchases have been relatively small and cannot fully explain the positive performance of BTPs. Overall, the contained yield spreads and strong demand from domestic investors have contributed to the favorable performance of Italian government bonds."

Additionally, the author explores how the availability of coal led to an increase in grain production and the abundance of muscle power, particularly horses, which were used for various industrial tasks.

Meta initially beat earnings estimates but reversed course during the conference call, leading to a negative outlook for ad sales. As a result, stock index futures are pointing to a lower open, particularly in the tech sector. Bonds have not been affected by the sell-off, with the 10-year yield remaining unchanged. In terms of commodities, WTI crude oil is down 1.5% while copper is up 0.6%. Several companies, including UPS, Hershey, Northrop Gruman, and Southwest Airlines, have reported earnings, with mixed results. After the market close, Amazon, Intel, Chipotle, and Ford are among the companies expected to report earnings. Economic data to be released includes the European Central Bank's decision on interest rates, third-quarter GDP growth, durable goods orders, initial jobless claims, and pending home sales. The tech sell-off may indicate a broader slowdown in ad spending, which could lead to job losses and impact the services sector. While the situation is currently isolated to tech, it could spread to other sectors."

        "summary": "Recent reports suggest that population immunity from prior infections and vaccinations is the main driver of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Currently, the leading variant in the United States is HV.1, a descendant of EG.5.1 and the family of recombinant XBB variants. However, a hyper-mutated variant called BA.2.86, also known as \"Pirola,\" has emerged and carries over 40 new mutations, including 34 in the spike protein alone. This variant is concerning because it has a high affinity for the ACE2 receptor and may have enhanced transmissibility. Another variant, JN.1, has shown a weak neutralizing antibody response to breakthrough infections. The L455S mutation in JN.1 promotes immune evasion. JN.1 has been detected in several countries, including France, the UK, and the US. It is unclear whether JN.1 will lead to a significant rise in Covid cases or how well our immune response will protect against it. The emergence of these new variants highlights the need for better vaccines to combat the evolving virus. In the meantime, getting a booster shot is recommended, especially for older individuals or those with compromised immune systems. Non-pharmacologic measures, such as preventive measures against respiratory viruses, are also important."

This is the highest price Buffett has paid for the stock, as he has typically not been willing to pay over $60. Berkshire now owns 25.8% of Occidental's common stock. The purchases come as Chevron announced its intention to acquire Hess in a $53 billion all-stock deal, and Exxon made a deal to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources for $60 billion. Buffett's investments in Occidental and Chevron are seen as statements on the continuing importance of oil in the global economy. The potential for a broader conflict in the Middle East and recent dealmaking by Chevron and Exxon may have influenced Buffett's purchases. Berkshire is likely to release its third-quarter earnings soon, which may reveal additional purchases of Chevron stock."

Google Cloud revenue growth slowed but still reached 22%. The company's earnings per share (EPS) increased by 18.8% year-to-date. Despite a decline in pre-market trading, Alphabet shares are still up 37% since January 2021. The company believes that the post-results decline was an overreaction, as it neglects the strong growth in the core advertising business. Google Advertising has returned to its normal growth trajectory, with total advertising revenues showing a ~15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for each quarter this year. YouTube ad revenues have also rebounded, with a 12.5% year-on-year growth. Google Cloud revenues were up 22% year-on-year in Q3, although there was a slight deceleration from Q2. The company has shown cost discipline, with costs growing less than revenues in Q3. Alphabet's net income was 41.5% higher year-on-year in Q3, and its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) grew by 24.6%. The company's free cash flow (FCF) was $37.2 billion year-to-date, up 76% year-on-year. With a P/E ratio of 24.7x and a FCF yield of 2.8%, Alphabet shares are considered cheap, and the company is expected to return 83% by 2026."

        "summary": "The article discusses the dangers of eliminating cash and transitioning to a fully digital payment system. It explains that cash is recognized as legal money, while bank balances are one step removed from legal money. The total cash in the economy, including bank reserves and cash held outside the banking system, is known as the monetary base. However, most of the money supply is composed of bank credit money not backed by reserves. The article highlights the risks of relying solely on electronic payments, such as infrastructure problems and the potential seizure of funds. It provides examples of bank accounts being frozen or closed for political reasons. The article also warns against the implementation of central bank digital currencies, as it would give governments the power to freeze accounts and restrict access to financial resources. The author argues that digital currencies pose a threat to civil liberties and should be stopped."

        "summary": "The collapse of the Chungthang dam in Sikkim, India, has raised concerns about the safety and viability of other mega dams in the Himalayas. The dam failure resulted in the deaths of at least 22 people and left over 100 missing. Environmentalists warn that similar projects in geologically risky areas, threatened by glacial lake outburst floods, earthquakes, climate change, and landslides, could lead to further devastation. The Teesta River, which is fed by glacial lakes, is particularly vulnerable to these risks. Despite opposition from local communities, the Indian government plans to construct three more \"mega Teestas\" in the Indian Himalayas. International organizations, such as International Rivers, urge the government to reconsider these plans, stating that hydropower is not a climate-friendly or sustainable energy solution. The construction of these dams also poses threats to the fragile Himalayan ecosystem and the livelihoods of indigenous communities. In addition to dam collapses, landslides and cracks in homes are concerns, as well as the disruption of migration routes and nesting areas for endangered species. The future of the Teesta River and its tributaries, including downstream in Bangladesh, is in jeopardy due to the proposed cascade of dams."

        "summary": "Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent removal of four ministers and demotion of former foreign minister Qin Gang is seen as a display of power, but analysts believe it actually reveals weaknesses in his leadership. The dismissals and demotions, which include the defense minister, finance minister, and science and technology minister, suggest upheaval in China's leadership. The fact that Xi could not name a replacement for the defense minister indicates a lack of confidence in the loyalty and ability of his top military brass. The removal of Qin Gang, who was previously sacked as foreign minister, suggests Xi's failure to nurture capable diplomats. The lack of explanation for the dismissals and the downfall of Li Shangfu, the defense minister, and Qin Gang is seen as a sign of dysfunction and opacity in China's leadership. The removals also highlight the lack of pushback or disagreement with Xi's decisions, indicating his unchallenged position. However, there are still forces working to undermine Xi's position, as evidenced by the leaks and the tensions and distrust within the party leadership."

The author argues that despite the increasing focus on renewable energy, the demand for petrochemicals is not changing quickly, and the supply is likely to decline. This will result in higher prices for oil and gas. The author also highlights the negative perception of the industry, which has led to a decrease in enrollment in petrochemical engineering programs and a lack of qualified replacements for retiring engineers. Additionally, the vilification of oil companies by politicians and the exclusion of oil companies from ESG mandates further limit investment in the industry. The author believes that these factors, along with the potential weakening of the dollar, make oil and gas stocks an attractive investment opportunity. The author advises being selective and investing in low-cost producers with strong balance sheets."

They believe that buying good, overcapitalized banks around book value can be a positive expected value bet, but with significant downside risks. The author also mentions that regional banks may engage in mergers and acquisitions to avoid regulatory burdens, which could lead to a wave of M&A activity in the future. They argue that the current environment is favorable for banks to make loans and generate positive earnings and asset values. The competitive landscape in banking has changed, with bankruptcies and funding challenges for fintech players, creating opportunities for well-capitalized banks to gain market share. The author suggests that investors should differentiate between banks by analyzing their balance sheets. Despite the fear in the market, the author believes that investing in a handful of good banks with a long-term view can result in excellent risk-adjusted returns."

Despite the decline, the bank's balance sheet remains solid, with conservative financing and a strong capital position. Earnings have been affected by changes in the rate environment and a one-off credit charge, but normalized earnings suggest a more accurate valuation. Shareholders currently receive a quarterly dividend, and the bank has excess capital that could potentially be used for buybacks. First Horizon currently trades at a discount to its peers, but its fundamentals and loan book are sound. Using a historical industry heuristic, the bank's valuation could be around $12.80 per share. While the banking industry as a whole has had a challenging year, owning First Horizon may be a good investment opportunity given its potential for growth and its discounted valuation."

Van Tulleken conducted an experiment where he ate an 80% ultra-processed food (UPF) diet for a month and found that he gained weight, experienced changes in brain connectivity, and had a heightened hunger hormone response. He also discovered that his identical twin brother, who at times is 20 kg heavier than him, eats a diet high in UPFs. Van Tulleken argues that UPFs, which are made with synthetic and artificial substances, are not only harmful to health but also contribute to a range of chronic conditions, including cancer, dementia, and inflammatory bowel disease. He calls for increased regulation of UPFs and highlights the need to address poverty and food deserts to improve access to healthy, unprocessed foods. Van Tulleken also challenges the prevailing beliefs surrounding calorie burning through exercise and the role of carbohydrates in weight gain, suggesting that the addictive nature of UPFs is a significant factor in the obesity epidemic."

It is also important to assess the company's moat, outlook, and whether they are serial diluters or offsetters. New rules for repurchase disclosures will be implemented in 2023 to provide greater transparency and scrutiny. Overall, identifying genuine share cannibals requires careful analysis of a company's actions and financial health."

        "summary": "Consumer products company Unconditional Love Inc., backed by actors Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware. The company, which sells environmentally-friendly family products under the Hello Bello brand, initially sold its products directly to consumers and through an exclusive partnership with Walmart. However, the company faced challenges when its diaper manufacturer increased production costs by 18%, which it couldn't pass on to customers due to restrictions from wholesalers Walmart and Amazon. The company attempted to vertically integrate its diaper manufacturing but faced issues, leading to financial difficulties exacerbated by rising global shipping costs and inflation. Unconditional Love Inc. has implemented cost-cutting measures and sought new sources of capital, with affiliated fund VMG Partners investing an additional $30 million. The company has entered bankruptcy court with a stalking horse asset purchase agreement from Bucky Acquisition HoldCo, affiliated with PE firm Hildred Capital Management, for a proposed purchase price of $65 million. The debtors have obtained a commitment for a $47 million debtor-in-possession financing to fund the sale process."

        "summary": "The article explores the roots of Bitcoin and its connection to the concept of crypto-anarchy. The Cypherpunks, a group of cryptographers, mathematicians, computer scientists, and activists, played a significant role in the development of Bitcoin and other projects such as Tor, PGP, and BitTorrent. The ideas of anarcho-capitalism, as advocated by economist David D. Friedman, science fiction writer Vernor Vinge, and philosopher Ayn Rand, influenced the Cypherpunks' vision of a decentralized, anarchic digital society. Friedman's book \"The Machinery of Freedom\" and Heinlein's novel \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\" were particularly influential in shaping their ideas. Bitcoin itself can be considered existing in a state of anarchy, as it operates without a central authority controlling it. The article highlights the interconnectedness of computers, open-source software, and cryptography as key factors in enabling the creation of this digital society. Ultimately, the article suggests that the creative thinking of individuals like Friedman and the work of the Cypherpunks laid the foundation for the development of Bitcoin."

        "summary": "Hedge fund manager Lawrence Lepard believes that the US is in a \"debt doom loop\" due to the sensitivity of Federal interest expenses to rapidly growing short-term yields. Lepard points out that half of the US Federal Debt will need to be rolled over within the next three years, and with interest rates currently at 2.49%, the government will have to pay higher rates as bonds mature. With the total US Federal Debt growing at $2-3 trillion per year, Lepard predicts that in two years, interest expenses will more than double the current rate, adding another $1 trillion to the deficit. Lepard acknowledges that timing is difficult, but he believes that \"monetary debasement\" is highly likely given the system of Governments and Central Banks. He remains confident in his investment thesis and expects significant upside when the debt doom loop occurs."

The containers are said to be filled with Soviet-era arms, including rockets and artillery shells. It is unclear which side initiated the arms transfers, but Russia is in need of conventional artillery pieces and shells, while North Korea has an ample stock of Soviet-era arms. The speedy deliveries of these munitions follow high-level meetings between North Korean and Russian officials, including a tour of North Korean defense facilities and Russian defense industry sites. The acquisition of high-tech weapons by North Korea could pose a direct threat to South Korea, and has alarmed South Korean officials. However, it is uncertain if Moscow is prepared to strike a deal, given Russia's support of North Korea's economy and concerns about North Korea's ethical standards in using foreign technology. China, which shares a border with North Korea, is also wary of North Korea's arms shopping tours and aims to maintain a balance in its relations with Pyongyang."

        "summary": "Approximately 10 million Americans have received the Fall 2023 Covid-19 vaccine, which is only about 3% of the eligible population and significantly lower than typical flu vaccine coverage. The comparison between this year's Covid-19 coverage and last year's is complicated by the fact that states are no longer required to report vaccine uptake to the CDC. However, models suggest that Covid-19 coverage is similar to last year when considering differential reporting. The lower coverage for Covid-19 can be attributed to several factors, including the year-round circulation of the virus compared to the seasonal circulation of the flu, debates about eligibility for the vaccine, lack of access and resources, and vaccine fatigue. To improve vaccine coverage, a comprehensive approach involving various stakeholders such as friends, family, schools, pharmacies, and employers is needed. This approach should focus on increasing trust, access, and coverage of vaccines."

        "summary": "Federal Reserve officials are expressing doubts about the claim that monetary policy is restrictive. They argue that current policy may actually be closer to \"neutral\" due to changes in income distribution, private sector balance sheets, and fiscal policy. Evidence from the real and financial sides of the economy suggests that policymakers should consider how they will respond if spending continues to grow faster than what is deemed sustainable. Even if short-term interest rates are not raised significantly, these pressures may prevent interest rates from being lowered in the near future. The argument that there are long and variable lags between short-term interest rates and financial conditions is flawed because financial conditions have not actually tightened. The Fed's latest Financial Stability Report acknowledges that stocks are expensive, credit spreads are tight, and property prices remain elevated. Despite an increase in default-free discount rates, the decline in risk premiums has offset this, leading to consumer and corporate borrowing remaining in line with pre-pandemic levels."

The possibility of a \"Blue-White\" unity ticket between the KMT and TPP has been discussed due to their combined potential to defeat the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate, Lai Ching-te. However, the KMT has previously insisted that their candidate should be at the top of the ticket. Hou's concession comes after Ko has consistently led in the polls. The KMT's proposal for a \"primary\" vote between the \"Hou-Ko\" ticket and the \"Ke-Hou\" ticket, with Hou as the vice president, has been criticized as disingenuous by Ko. The formation of a unity ticket poses challenges for both parties, as being on the bottom of the ticket is seen as a poor consolation prize. The KMT risks consolidating TPP as a permanent rival, while TPP risks losing its identity as an independent party. Additionally, there are voters who detest one party but support the other, making the unity ticket less effective."

While some investors believe that activist shorts are unfair and biased, others argue that they serve an important function in the market by providing new information and improving price discovery. Short sellers have the incentive to sell a stock short and profit from negative information about a company, which can help prevent losses for other shareholders. Hindenburg's report on Icahn Enterprises (IEP) was not particularly impressive as it mainly contained information that was already public. However, Hindenburg's credibility allowed it to move the stock, resulting in negative total returns for IEP. Despite the controversy surrounding activist shorts, they can provide opportunities for investors, whether they are right or wrong in their assessments. It is important to respect and listen to what activist shorts have to say, as they can provide valuable insights."

Two examples of diffusion indexes used in business cycles are the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) and the Tankan survey.

The IMF's debt projections, in particular, are no longer accurate. The WEO was based on the assumption that the 10-year government bond yield for the United States would average 3.8% in 2023 and 4.0% in 2024. However, with the recent repricing of yields, the average for 2023 is projected to be 4.1% and 5.0% for 2024. This means that the analysis of public sector debt dynamics in the WEO database does not reflect the current global prospects. The projections for Italian debt-to-GDP also rely on optimistic assumptions. Despite fiscal slippage and changes in the Italian yield curve, Italian debt-to-GDP is projected to be lower than previously estimated. This is due to higher nominal GDP and a more aggressive adjustment of the primary balance. However, these projections may not be sustainable given the recent changes in global yields."

        "summary": "The article discusses the concept of price versus value in investing. It highlights the idea that a good business may not necessarily be a good stock, and vice versa. The key is to identify the gap between price and value and determine if there is a significant mispricing. The author uses the example of Intel's stock price only declining slightly after NVIDIA's announcement, suggesting that the market may have already priced in the news or that Intel's stock was already undervalued. The article emphasizes the importance of considering both price and fundamental value when evaluating investments. It also mentions the concept of asymmetric risk-reward, where investing in undervalued stocks with low multiples can provide both downside protection and upside potential. The author concludes by discussing the upcoming Part 2 report on Intel, which will delve into the company's future prospects and financial performance."

        "summary": "The world is currently engaged in a global conflict that has been overlooked and misunderstood. The war is not like previous world wars, but rather a new kind of warfare that takes place in multiple domains simultaneously. The conflict extends beyond Ukraine and the Middle East, with hot wars occurring in space, the Arctic, and the oceans. There is also a cold war being fought in Africa and the Pacific, where Russia and China are supporting uprisings and vying for influence. The lack of a comprehensive narrative to explain this larger confrontation between superpowers hinders the proper understanding and resolution of the geopolitical problem. Instead, attention is focused on the difficult questions of whether to support Israel and Ukraine and whether these conflicts can be won. However, the nature of this war requires a broader perspective, as it involves all domains and utilizes tactics such as weaponizing food and energy prices to inflict pain on civilian populations. The changing nature of warfare and the effectiveness of technology have rendered traditional weapons less significant. It is crucial to recognize the complexity and scope of this global conflict in order to address its challenges effectively."

The layoffs come as the company looks to reduce costs and streamline operations. GEICO has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with fewer people driving and making insurance claims. The company has also faced increased competition from other insurers. Despite the layoffs, GEICO remains committed to its long-term growth strategy and plans to continue investing in technology and customer service. The company is optimistic about the future and believes that as the economy recovers, there will be increased demand for auto insurance. GEICO is known for its low-cost auto insurance policies and has a strong customer base.

        "summary": "The Precautionary Principle is a concept that advocates for exercising caution in the face of potential irreversible systemic threats posed by certain technological changes. However, Marc Andreessen, in his Techno-Optimist Manifesto, criticizes the principle, calling it \"deeply immoral\" and claiming it would have prevented all progress since the discovery of fire. This blanket statement fails to acknowledge the nuanced application of the principle, which is not about blocking all progress but rather being cautious in specific cases that could have serious negative systemic effects. The debate over the precautionary principle is particularly relevant in the context of artificial intelligence (AI), with Andreessen advocating for unrestricted progress while others, like Elon Musk, argue for greater caution. It is important to consider the economic motives of those involved in the AI debate and not dismiss the principle itself. Society must carefully navigate potentially severe and irreversible technological changes."

This has caused issues for US firms, including Intel and Nvidia, whose business and income heavily rely on China's manufacturing industry. The US is also pressuring companies in countries like Japan and the Netherlands, which are crucial partners for Chinese companies building their semiconductor ecosystem. However, there is some optimism as US officials have expressed openness to input from the semiconductor industry to find ways to continue sending AI chips to China for small and medium-sized systems. On the other side, Chinese tech rivals are winning more contracts, with local manufacturers winning nearly half of all machinery equipment tenders by Chinese foundries. The article also mentions Apple CEO Tim Cook's surprise visit to China as the US-China standoff threatens to impact Apple's sales in the country. In other news, Baidu unveiled its latest AI model, India plans to set up a semiconductor research center, and Singapore's regulator raises concerns about Grab's plan to acquire taxi rival Trans-cab."

The Philippines sent supplies to troops stationed on a World War Two-era transport ship, prompting China's coastguard to block the resupply missions. A collision occurred between Chinese and Filipino vessels, with China claiming it was attempting to block the delivery of \"illegal construction materials.\" The Philippines denounced China's actions as a violation of its sovereignty. The incident is the latest in a series of escalating conflicts between the two countries. The Philippines has vowed to conduct a quick investigation, and the US has expressed support for the Philippines, reaffirming its security pact. The Chinese foreign ministry accused the US of disregarding the facts and violating international law. The situation is complicated, as the US has a security treaty with the Philippines that obliges it to assist in the event of an armed attack. President Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos Jr. is navigating delicate relations with both the US and China. Some speculate that China may be taking advantage of the US's current focus on other global issues to assert its dominance in the region."

The US and Philippines national security advisors held a call to discuss the incident. The Philippines is using the grounded ship to secure its territory, but it may break up before the end of the year, which the PRC is waiting for to swoop in and declare possession. The Philippines needs concrete and construction materials to resupply the Sierra Madre, but it can't do it alone. If it asks the US for help, it could turn into a US-China crisis. Wang Yi, the Chinese Foreign Minister, will visit the US this week, likely as part of the effort to have General Secretary Xi Jinping attend APEC in San Francisco next month and meet with President Biden. The MSS and CCTV have released details of an alleged case of a PRC researcher becoming an American spy. Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, is being investigated by mainland authorities for tax and land use issues, which some speculate is an attempt to get the company's founder, Terry Gou, to drop out of the Taiwan presidential election. The National Financial Work Conference will convene in Beijing next week to address the local government debt crisis and the real estate debt crisis. Huijin is buying shares in ETFs and increasing stakes in big banks to support the falling stock market. Securities Times is calling for the removal of price limits on land auctions and new home prices to support the real estate market. Evan Osnos has published an article in the New Yorker about the darkening mood in China. The Party is expected to hold a Third Plenum before the end of the year, and not convening one would send a worrisome signal."

The short TLT leg has been successful, with TLT falling from 160 to 83. Despite the decline, investors have been buying TLT, causing shares outstanding to quadruple since 2022. Short interest has remained low, resulting in significant losses for TLT owners and minimal gains for short sellers. The yield curve inversion made TLT an attractive short, but it has since disappeared. However, TLT is an ETF designed to remain a long-dated treasury, and its dividend yield versus cash (Fed Funds Rate) suggests it is still a good short. The author believes yields will continue to rise, making TLT an even better short. If there is a reduction in shares outstanding or an increase in short interest, a tactical cover may be considered."

Some analysts believe that this is a temporary policy to keep oil prices down, but it is unlikely that the SPR will ever be refilled. The decline in US oil production is becoming more likely as Permian drillers are completing more wells than they are drilling, leading to a decrease in new production. In the renewable energy sector, the offshore wind industry is facing challenges as new investors enter the market, increasing competition for assets and diminishing returns. However, the problems faced by companies like Orsted are not a failure of government policy but rather a result of its success in attracting new investors. Tradable carbon prices remain strong, indicating that a compromise will likely be reached to support the growth of offshore wind generation. Overall, the green energy revolution is expected to continue, with declining investment in fossil energy and a need for rising energy prices to support the growing competition for green assets."

President Joko Widodo has maneuvered Prabowo Subianto, a figure from the New Order era, into the lead as the presidential candidate and has chosen his own unqualified son, Gibran Rakabuming, as the vice presidential running mate. Critics argue that this move undermines the democratic process and could lead to a political dynasty. The Constitutional Court's decision to lower the minimum age for vice presidential candidates, allowing Gibran to run, has also been criticized as nepotistic. The situation has sparked worries about the weakening of democracy and civil liberties in Indonesia. The court's decision has the potential to trigger further political conflict in the 2024 elections. Despite the controversy, Prabowo is trying to win over Jokowi's supporters by recruiting Gibran as his deputy. Jokowi denies interfering in Gibran's nomination, but his relationship with his party, the PDIP, has deteriorated. Overall, the situation is seen as a threat to Indonesian democracy and raises concerns about the consolidation of power and the normalization of corruption, collusion, and nepotism."

The Millennials also have a more intense Islamic education, leading to a transformation of the \"Malay agenda\" into a \"Malay-Islamic agenda.\" The Gen Zers, who are entering the lower positions of the civil service, share the same Islam-centric worldview as the Millennials but have more self-centered values. These generational changes are expected to narrow the diversity of thinking within the civil service and create a more rules-based environment. The civil service will also face challenges in terms of a loss of historical experience and a bloated and inefficient structure. Additionally, the majority of civil servants tend to have political sympathies towards the PAS side of politics."

        "summary": "Around 200 farmers in the Kanthan district of Perak, Malaysia are being affected by the takeover of their land for an industrial estate. The land is owned by the Perak State Development Corporation (PSDC), a subsidiary of the Perak state government. Six farmers were recently evicted from prime vegetable growing land, despite their request for alternative land from the PSDC. During the eviction, a PSM activist was allegedly injured by an officer from the Perak Land and Minerals Office (PTG). Four individuals, including PSM chairperson Dr. Michael Jeyakumar Devaraj, have been arrested for trying to stop the eviction. The PSM has called on Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to intervene and save the farmers. Anwar's constituency office did send someone to the site to negotiate for more time on behalf of the farmers."

The Romans used elevators to transport construction materials and animals in the Colosseum. Elevators for passengers took longer to develop, with King Louis XV of France believed to be one of the first to use them. The Industrial Revolution led to the development of steam-powered elevators, but safety concerns arose after fatal accidents. Elisha Graves Otis solved this problem by inventing a safety system based on a brake. Otis Elevator Company was founded and became a leading elevator manufacturer. KONE, a Finnish manufacturer, also entered the elevator industry and is now the third largest manufacturer in the world. The elevator business is competitive, with manufacturers vying for projects and maintenance contracts. Maintenance contracts are the most lucrative part of the business, generating high gross and operating margins. Elevators can cost between \u20ac30,000 and 500,000, and each geography has different dynamics and competition. Building route density and optimization are important for success in the industry."

        "summary": "Aardman's Creature Comforts, a concept that began as a short film in 1989, has become a major success due to its unscripted, everyday human speech used as dialogue for animation. The appeal of the project lies in the ability to watch animals talk like average people about their lives, creating a mix of droll, hilarious, and tragic moments. The success of Creature Comforts is attributed to the believability of the dialogue and the creativity and experimentation of the Aardman team. The concept was initially conceived, directed, and animated by Nick Park, who faced challenges in finding the right material for the dialogue. However, the breakthrough came when they interviewed people who were in a similar situation to animals in a zoo, resulting in funnier and more honest conversations. The short film won an Oscar and led to a hit series of commercials and a major TV show. Aardman's unscripted style of dialogue has its roots in the work of Faith and John Hubley, who used improvisation and editing techniques to create authentic and natural dialogue in their animations. Creature Comforts has since become a successful TV show, with thousands of hours of interviews conducted to gather material for the characters' dialogue. The series retains the spontaneous and engaging nature of the original short film and ads, despite being pieced together from thousands of odds and ends."

        "summary": "Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has suspended his plan to launch a sovereign wealth fund, the Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF), sparking speculation and skepticism. The president's explanation that the suspension is to make improvements to the organizational structure of the project has raised questions about the competence of lawmakers and decision-makers. The hasty process by which the fund was pushed through Congress and signed into law has also been criticized. The state-owned Land Bank and Development Bank of the Philippines have already transferred significant amounts of capital to the fund, putting their resources at risk. The suspension has led to rumors that Marcos intends to appoint his finance secretary, Benjamin Diokno, as the president and CEO of MIF, which could lead to a cabinet shakeup. However, there are concerns that the fund will fail to attract private funding support, as the Philippines is not a preferred destination for foreign investment. The weak investor interest is partly due to the country's image of lacking law and order, with high crime rates and extrajudicial killings. To attract investors and tourists, the president needs to prioritize creating a more tourist- and investor-friendly image for the country. One option is to seek funding from the country's richest individuals, who have a combined net worth of over $65 billion. However, there must be clear provisions to ensure that the fund is managed by private equity partners without government involvement. The president's goal is to raise Gross National Income per capita by 2024 and redeem the Marcos name."

Environmental regulation, for example, has been outsourced to the courts, causing delays and increased costs for infrastructure projects. The reliance on nonprofits and consultants also creates agency problems, as these entities may prioritize their own interests over efficient use of government funds. Additionally, the lack of a strong bureaucracy has hindered the country's ability to respond effectively to crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The author argues that it is time to bring back bureaucrats and invest in rebuilding the civil service. This would involve expanding and upgrading the federal workforce, improving tax collection, overhauling information technology systems, streamlining environmental review processes, and revitalizing public health institutions. The author emphasizes the need for a competent, well-funded bureaucracy to address current challenges and prepare for future threats, such as a potential war with China."

However, the excessive focus on reason and materialism has led to negative consequences. The rejection of metaphysics and religion has resulted in a loss of the sacred and a narrow view of reality. The Enlightenment's reliance on empirical knowledge and the belief that everything can be explained through matter has limited our understanding of consciousness and other mental phenomena. Science is slowly recognizing the limitations of a materialistic worldview and is undergoing a paradigm shift to find better explanations. It is important to acknowledge the limitations of reason and embrace a more holistic approach that integrates science, reasoning, intuition, and the sacred. Coexistence between science and the non-empirical is possible and necessary for a more comprehensive understanding of the world."

Despite the decline, the bank's balance sheet remains solid, with conservative financing and a strong capital position. Earnings have been affected by changes in the rate environment and a one-off credit charge, but normalized earnings suggest a more accurate valuation. Shareholders currently receive a quarterly dividend, and the bank has excess capital that could potentially be used for buybacks. First Horizon currently trades at a discount to its peers, but its fundamentals and loan book are sound. Using a historical industry heuristic, the bank's valuation could be around $12.80 per share. While the banking industry as a whole has had a challenging year, owning First Horizon may be a good investment opportunity given its potential for growth and its discounted valuation."

While many countries condemned Hamas' attack on Israel, Malaysia and Indonesia voiced support for Hamas and blamed Israel for the confrontation. Malaysia's stance is problematic due to previous reports of a training program in Malaysia that coached Hamas fighters. The European Union, which values democracy and human rights, should apply its principles to Malaysia and make it clear that economic relations will suffer if Malaysia continues to support Hamas. Malaysia's ties with Hamas blur the line between militants and Palestinian civilians and provide a platform for an organization whose goal is to cause destruction. Malaysia's support of Hamas puts it in the company of pariah countries like Iran, Syria, and Algeria. The Malaysian government's support of Hamas is causing political isolation and may strain relations with Western partners like the United States."

        "summary": "Ben Felix's views on passive investing are criticized for containing gaps and oversimplifications that betray an agenda. Felix himself does not strictly adhere to a passive approach, but leans toward systematic value investing. His arguments are based on a simplified presentation of models such as the Grossman-Stiglitz model and various Fama-French papers, which are criticized for not adequately accounting for market realities and inefficiencies. Ralph Koijen's work is cited to counter Felix's argument that the growth of index funds won't affect markets, stating that the composition of investors in the market matters significantly. The rise of passive investing has led to a noticeable increase in valuations, especially among larger stocks. Citations of measures of \"price informativeness\" as a measure of market efficiency may miss nuanced factors such as feedback loops created by passive investing strategies. The article also highlights the irony that Felix himself does not invest in passive index funds, but follows a systematic value investing approach."

The company's plans for a slower rollout of its IQOS product in the US in 2024 may hinder its progress. Additionally, flavor bans in the EU are impacting PMI's heated tobacco unit (HTU) inventories. Despite these setbacks, PMI remains confident in its ability to capture 10% of the cigarette and HTU market share in the US by 2030. The company's Q3 results showed growth in HTU volumes and an increase in IQOS users. PMI's distribution network and direct relationships with consumers are key strengths that have contributed to the success of IQOS. The company's aggressive pricing strategy and focus on smoke-free products have also driven growth. However, PMI's Wellness & Healthcare segment has struggled to find its footing and is seen as a drain on resources. Overall, PMI's ability to generate long-term value remains strong."

He also noted that the level of private sector credit, rather than the rate of growth, is the critical factor. Montier expressed concern about the risk of recession, high market valuations, and the concentration of debt by sector. He suggested three routes to protect portfolios: holding cash, using options, and using strategies with a negative correlation to tail risk. Montier discussed the challenges and expenses associated with option protection and highlighted the potential benefits of a quality minus junk strategy. He also emphasized the high valuation of quality stocks and expressed a preference for a value versus growth strategy.

Some members of the cabinet are incompetent, like Fahmi, while others are directly disobeying Anwar. The blocking of websites by Fahmi is seen as a warning to Anwar about the destruction his own cabinet is causing to his government.

He also mentions the case of television, which went from being absent in most homes to having multiple sets in almost every home, yet the profitability of U.S. TV manufacturers is likely negative.

        "summary": "Exxon Mobil's CEO, Darren Woods, faced pressure from environmentalists and activist investors to reduce the company's carbon footprint. In a surprising turn of events, the activist investor, Engine No. 1, successfully installed three directors on Exxon's board with the support of major institutional investors like BlackRock and Vanguard. This marked a major triumph for climate activists and a defeat for Exxon. BlackRock's CEO, Larry Fink, had been emphasizing the importance of addressing climate change and published a report supporting Engine No. 1's move. However, in the years that followed, Fink faced backlash from conservative paymasters and the global energy crisis highlighted the significance of fossil fuels. In contrast, Woods kept Exxon on strategy and made strategic moves to position the company for long-term value creation. The article explores Woods' maneuvers and the potential payoff for Exxon."

        "summary": "The stock market has experienced a rough few months, with the Russell down 10%+ since September and the S&P down 6% since the beginning of September. This comes after a brutal couple of years for small cap investors, with the Russell down ~25% over the past two years. Despite this, the author believes that now is a good time to be buying stocks, as there is a lot of fear in the market and stocks are trading at attractive valuations. The rise in interest rates is a major concern for investors, but the author argues that the equity market never fully discounted how low interest rates were. The S&P is currently trading for just under 20x P/E, which the author believes is not a crazy number and could even be considered cheap given current interest rates. While some larger cap names trade at premium multiples, there is real value to be found in the market for investors willing to dig a little."

        "summary": "Willis Johnson, the founder of Copart, started his entrepreneurial journey in the junkyard business. He learned the value of hard work and discipline while working on his family's dairy farm and dismantling cars for scrap metal. He eventually focused on selling car parts individually, which allowed him to command higher prices. He also specialized in Chrysler, Dodge, and Plymouth parts, which differentiated him from his competitors. In the 1980s, Johnson purchased BTS Auctions and transformed it into Copart Auctions. He introduced the Percentage Incentive Program (PIP), which allowed insurance companies to split the increase in price from making salvaged cars look nicer. Copart also embraced technology early on, launching an online platform for buyers to bid on cars. The company experienced significant growth and went public in 1994. It continued to expand through acquisitions and the development of a national network of yards. Copart's success can be attributed to its focus on customer needs, operational efficiency, and technological innovation."

        "summary": "The emergence of three mega risks\u2014War, Inflation/Stagflation, and Rich Country Government Debt Burdens\u2014is shaping up to add new dimensions of uncertainty to an already messy energy transition era. Rising tensions in the Middle East following the terrorist attack by Hamas in Israel add a second theatre of conflict to go along with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. After a 40-year run of contained inflation and declining interest rates, the 2020s are shaping up to be a different environment. Energy prices are likely to contribute to higher future inflation as both traditional and new energy supply are not on-track to meet global needs. The risk of adverse consequences from continuously rising government debt levels in the United States is increasing. The magnitude of yet-to-be-met energy demand among the other 7 billion people on Earth overwhelmingly points to the need for all forms of energy. Traditional energy sectors may serve as a hedge to the growing mega risks, potentially counter-balancing its recession exposure. New energy technologies have an important role to play in meeting global energy needs, but getting the economics right is more important than an impossibly fast transition."

Bridgen emphasized the need for a comprehensive analysis of excess deaths to understand the true impact of the pandemic and to inform future policy decisions. He also called for an investigation into the accuracy of COVID-19 death statistics and raised concerns about the potential long-term consequences of delayed medical treatments and missed diagnoses.

The scheme not only defrauds people but also helps them evade taxes. Famous individuals, lawyers, celebrities, insurance agents, and bank agents have been promoting this Ponzi scheme. Victims are tricked into signing various contracts, and when the companies are unable to repay them, they realize they are trapped and cannot retrieve their hard-earned money. Some of the companies involved in this scam include UBB Amanah Berhad, ZICO Trust Malaysia Berhad, Infinity Trustee Berhad (now known as Perintis Amanah Berhad), Global Asset Trustee Berhad, Citadel Trustee Berhad, Asia International Trust Berhad, Amanah Warisan Berhad, ACE Holding Berhad, and Pacific Trustees Group International Berhad.

        "summary": "The geopolitical risk of conflict in the Middle East continues to pose a significant threat, as seen by the steady oil prices at $90 per barrel. In an attempt to alleviate the upward pressure on oil, the US has lifted sanctions against Venezuela for six months, allowing them to tap into their significant crude reserves. Precious metals, such as gold and silver, have regained their status as safe-haven assets due to tensions in the Middle East and missile launches against Israel. Interest rates remain a focal point for investors, with long-term rates still weak and inflation expectations rising alongside the increase in oil prices. European long-term rates continue to rise, despite weak economic data. Stock markets, particularly in Europe, have been heavily impacted by selling pressure, with the DAX, Milan, and Paris indices all experiencing significant declines. Economists have conflicting opinions on the US economy, with some predicting a recession that has not materialized, while others have raised their growth projections due to robust consumer spending. The Beige Book, a monthly survey of regional Fed banks, paints a less solid economic picture. In China, despite concerns in the real estate sector, real GDP growth has accelerated, retail sales have improved, and unemployment has decreased. Central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Korea, are expected to maintain cautious monetary policies due to geopolitical uncertainties."

Japan's exports to China, which make up a substantial portion of its GDP, have already declined, and a further decline could lead to a mild recession. The ongoing techno-war between China and the West, as well as corporate espionage, have also caused Japanese companies to slow down their investment in China. Japan's declining exports to China and its loss of market share in the country have been ongoing issues. Additionally, the tension between China and the West over technology has led to the cutting off of critical technologies to China, further impacting its economic growth potential. Japan, along with the US and Europe, has joined in restricting China's access to advanced technologies. The article highlights the vulnerability of Japan's economy to China's economic and political troubles and the need for Japan to diversify its supply chains and reduce its reliance on China."

Graham's approach allows for companies to turn around and improve their fundamentals over time. The recent CEO change at Unity, a gaming company, did not have a lasting positive impact on the stock due to the lost trust of game developers and studios. Stanley Druckenmiller, an investment icon, takes a bottom-up approach to investing, focusing on company-specific information rather than macroeconomic indicators.

He launched Quercus Fund with a fee structure similar to Warren Buffett's partnerships in the 50s and 60s, with zero management fees and performance fees only above a certain threshold. Milano's ideal investment is an extremely undervalued business with a healthy balance sheet, poised for a significant increase in earnings and with a long runway for reinvestment. However, he acknowledges that clear investment cases are rarely extremely undervalued and there are usually issues that cloud the future and justify the undervaluation. The most important requirement for Milano is a large discrepancy between the price and conservatively appraised value of the investment."

After being captured and imprisoned, Holker escaped and eventually became an industrial spymaster for the French government. His main task was to steal British textile technologies, as Britain was already at the forefront of European technological development in many industries, including textiles, before the Industrial Revolution. Holker set up a network of agents in England and enticed skilled workers to come to France, where he ensured their skills were spread to French workers. The French government provided financial incentives and subsidies to promote the adoption of British techniques. Holker's efforts were successful, and he was promoted to Inspector-General of Manufactures. His son, John Holker Jr., followed in his footsteps as an industrial spy. Holker's career highlights his talent for espionage and his contribution to the transfer of technology between countries during this period."

However, stock index futures are rebounding, led by tech, while bonds are seeing some bids. Commodities, including WTI crude oil, gold, and silver, are also rebounding. Earnings season has begun, with BlackRock, UnitedHealth, and JPMorgan beating estimates. Several banks, including Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and PNC Financial, are due to report today. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey is also expected to be released. Inflation concerns persist, with renewed expectations of an interest rate hike at the next Fed meeting. Bank earnings are expected to distract from these concerns, with Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan providing unique insight into consumer behavior. Dimon has expressed concerns about the current state of the world but believes US consumers remain healthy."

Bonds are seeing some selling at the long end of the curve, with the 10-year and 30-year yields up 6 basis points each. Commodities are relatively stable, with copper up 0.5% and WTI crude oil unchanged. Cryptocurrencies are rallying, with Bitcoin up 3% to trade around $27,700. In terms of known events, Charles Schwab is set to report earnings before the open, and the Empire State Manufacturing Index for October is expected to decline. The situation in the Middle East, inflation, and the Fed are major concerns for investors, with earnings season adding to the mix. If anything upsets the equation, such as a broader war in the Middle East or a more hawkish Fed, it could overshadow earnings."

The author highlights the parallels in terms of the exponential growth in demand and the belief in scaling to larger networks or neural networks. They also note the high capital intensity of both industries. However, the author emphasizes that there are significant differences, such as the lower leverage in the AI industry compared to the telecom bubble, the lower barrier to entry in AI, and the current rate hike cycle that has prevented excessive speculation. The author also discusses the importance of supply reacting to demand and how supply in the AI industry is likely to eventually overshoot demand. Overall, the article provides insights into the potential risks and dynamics of the current AI and infrastructure boom."

        "summary": "Momentum is building towards the development of a nasal COVID-19 vaccine, with promising results from early clinical trials and new funding awards. The rationale for a nasal vaccine is based on the need for population-wide respiratory mucosal immunity to combat the evolving virus and its variants. Experimental studies have shown that nasal vaccines can provide tissue-level mucosal immunity, which is lacking in intramuscular vaccines. Nasal vaccines have been found to induce strong mucosal immunity, lower viral loads, and reduce disease and fatality. They also have the potential to provide variant-proof protection. Two companies, Castlevax and Codagenix, have recently announced the results of their Phase 1 human trials for nasal vaccines and have received funding from the US government to accelerate clinical development. Additionally, researchers at Ohio State University have developed a triple intranasal vaccine against measles, mumps, and COVID-19, which has shown a potent immune response in animal models. While there is still a need for further clinical trials, the development of a safe and effective nasal vaccine could provide durable protection against COVID-19 and help in the fight against the ongoing pandemic."

        "summary": "On October 7, 2023, Israel experienced a terrorist attack that resulted in the deaths of approximately 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The attackers, Palestinian militants from the Gaza Strip, carried out the atrocities up close and proudly displayed their war crimes on social media. The author compares the attack to the September 11, 2001 attacks, noting that while fewer civilians were killed in the recent attack, a larger percentage of Israel's population was affected. The article condemns the actions of the terrorists and criticizes far-left political organizations in the United States for endorsing Hamas, the group responsible for the attack. The author also reflects on the history of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians and emphasizes the need for civilized societies to minimize civilian casualties. The article concludes with a personal note from the author, who has family ties to the Holocaust, expressing the duty to speak out against evil."

        "summary": "When a company goes public, it must balance the interests of current shareholders with the goal of raising equity capital. Shareholders want to maximize the valuation of shares, but this carries risks in the long run. Opening for trading below the offering price can be embarrassing and demoralizing. To navigate this, current owners should disclose as much as possible about the business without compromising its competitive position. Warren Buffett's approach to issuing Class B shares in 1996 serves as an example. The players involved in the IPO process have different perspectives based on their incentives. Owners participating in the offering want top dollar, while those planning to exit soon also prefer a high valuation. Owners planning to hold their interest indefinitely want a price that compensates for dilution. The composition of the board of directors determines the dominant owner constituency. Short-term oriented owners may use aggressive accounting methods and non-GAAP metrics to present the business in the best light. Long-term oriented owners prefer candid disclosures. Executive management should have significant stock ownership and stock-based compensation with a multi-year vesting period."

        "summary": "Dollar General has announced the return of Todd Vasos as CEO, replacing Jeff Owen. The news was well-received by investors, with the stock closing up 9.2%. The company's stock had previously declined by 61% from its 52-week high. The press release provided little context for Owen's firing, but the board stated that a change in leadership was necessary to restore stability and confidence in the company. Dollar General also provided updated guidance for its fiscal year, with same-store sales expected to decline by 1% to 0% and diluted earnings per share expected to range from $7.10 to $7.60. The firing of Owen suggests that the board believes the company's problems are company-specific rather than macroeconomic. There are concerns that Dollar General's underlying strategy may be fragile if a new CEO can cause instability and loss of confidence in just a few quarters. The article questions whether Owen's appointment represented continuity or a new direction for the company."

Meanwhile, Didi, another ride-hailing company, plans to list its shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange next year. Didi's shares plummeted after its initial listing in New York due to the US-China political climate. The planned listing in Hong Kong could be a long-awaited payoff for investors and employees. In other news, SoftBank is developing a new investment business called 'Project R' that is separate from its Vision Fund. The venture fund formerly known as Sequoia China, now called HongShan, is reportedly looking to expand globally."

        "summary": "Early-stage startup funding in Southeast Asia is experiencing a mini boom, with seed and Series A stage activity increasing year-on-year. While later stage deals have declined, there is a growing interest in pre-seed investments, with larger VC firms in the region starting to invest in the bottom of the value chain. The global economic slowdown and the difficulty of landing big investments have pushed fund managers to flock to early-stage deals. Pre-seed investments offer the opportunity for accelerators and angels to pick up stakes in promising startups at low valuations. The failure rate is high for these early investments, but fund managers only need one or two successful startups to generate significant returns. The emergence of more early-stage funding and mentorship resources, managed by senior operators and founders, may change the way accelerators and incubation programs operate in the region. Overall, the increase in early-stage capital is positive for Southeast Asia's startup ecosystem during the current funding winter."

Gun culture in Thailand is pervasive, and the government's failure to introduce meaningful reform is highlighted.

        "summary": "Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for a ceasefire between Palestine and Israel during a meeting with the Prime Minister of Egypt. The Chinese foreign ministry and some propaganda outlets have criticized the US for vetoing a draft UN Security Council resolution on the crisis. There is speculation about whether the Third Plenum of the 20th Party Congress will convene in November, as the absence of an announcement in the September Politburo meeting was surprising. The Party typically holds at least one Plenum per year, and skipping one this year would send a negative signal. The dates for the Third Plenum of the 18th Party Congress were announced in the readout of the October 29, 2013 Politburo meeting, and the Plenum took place less than two weeks later. It is expected that there will be a readout of the October Politburo meeting in the next week or so, which will reveal whether or not the Third Plenum of the 20th Party Congress will convene in November."

The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that an Israeli evacuation order, which has instructed civilians to move to the south of Gaza, would worsen the already dire humanitarian situation. The WHO has warned that forcing over 2,000 patients to relocate to already overwhelmed health facilities in southern Gaza could be a death sentence. In Sudan, the six-month-long war has resulted in over 9,000 deaths and 5.6 million people being displaced. The conflict shows no signs of ending, with both sides refusing to back down. Aid groups are calling for more international assistance as civilians suffer the most. In Ecuador, a presidential run-off election is taking place amidst a backdrop of violence and a rising crime problem. The country has experienced a surge in fighting between drug cartels in recent years, leading to a decline in peace and stability."

In India, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal to legalize same-sex marriage, stating that the decision should be made by parliament. However, the Chief Justice emphasized the government's responsibility to uphold LGBTQ+ rights and end discrimination. In Sudan, a war between the military and the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group has resulted in the starvation of 42 Sudanese refugees in Chad. Over one million people have fled to Chad, but the international community has not provided sufficient aid."

The Gaza health ministry blames an Israeli air strike, while Israel claims a misfired rocket by the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad is to blame. Independent verification by trusted media outlets with expertise in Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is crucial in determining the truth. In Sudan's Darfur region, at least 68 villages have been set on fire in the past six months, indicating ethnic cleansing, according to evidence based on satellite imagery, social media data, and Nasa heat-recognition technology. Uganda vows to hunt down those responsible for killing a safari guide and a honeymooning couple from the UK and South Africa in a national park. The ISIS-linked Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) armed group is blamed for the attack, with ISIS claiming responsibility. The ADF is a Ugandan group that operates in the deep bush of neighboring Congo and has increased its attacks in recent months."

A study using large language models found that the GPT 3.5 model successfully identified corporate risks from earnings call transcripts, with higher risk exposure associated with higher market returns. JP Morgan's report on business failures revealed that most failures were outside of management's control, and concentration was found to be both an engine of wealth creation and a potential destroyer of wealth. Research on corporate insider trading found that all insider transactions generated significant abnormal returns, with outlier transactions having higher returns. These findings suggest that corporate insiders exploit their access to non-public information for an unfair advantage in the market."

        "summary": "Jeff Skilling, the former CEO of Enron, was convicted of conspiracy, insider trading, and securities fraud during the Enron scandal. Skilling and other executives at Enron artificially inflated revenues and hid losses through accounting and corporate fraud. Skilling sold millions of shares before the company's collapse, pocketing millions of dollars. Insider trading by company executives is not uncommon, accounting for 4% of the SEC's actions in 2021. Recent examples include the CEO of Silicon Valley Bank selling shares before the bank collapsed and the Pfizer CEO selling stock on the day the company announced success in clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine. Studies suggest that corporate insiders exploit their access to non-public information for unfair market advantage, and the profits generated from insider trading are statistically significant. Detecting illegal insider trading is challenging, but researchers have developed methods to identify potential trading on non-public information. The SEC requires company insiders to report changes in their holdings, and this data is publicly available. Researchers have used time stamps from audit letters to identify if insiders traded on non-public information. Their findings have been presented to the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board."

        "summary": "The FDA has issued Marketing Denial Orders on six menthol and other flavored variants of British American Tobacco's (BAT) Vuse Alto, causing BAT's American Depository Receipts to fall by 4.8%. However, the bans were not a surprise and BAT is challenging them in court, with a good chance of receiving a stay on their implementation. Previous FDA bans have been overturned, and even if the bans were to take effect, Vuse has demonstrated 100% volume retention in a similar ban in California. The key risk remains the FDA's plan to ban menthol cigarettes, which account for 60% of BAT's US cigarette sales. However, previous menthol bans have shown volume retention of 65%+ in the same category and up to 110% including other categories. BAT's low valuation and leadership in vapor products make it a good investment, and the risk from Philip Morris' IQOS menthol products is limited as they are not expected to have a meaningful impact until after 2025. Overall, BAT's shares have a 6.5x P/E and a 14.7% Free Cash Flow Yield, making them an attractive investment."

Deposits, Net Interest Margin, and Net Interest Income (NII) were all relatively flat. While NII is expected to decline modestly, management anticipates it will resume growing in Q3 2024. Investment Banking fees remain below pre-COVID levels, but Sales & Trading revenues have increased. Non-Interest Expenses have continued to decrease, and credit costs for the year are comparable to pre-COVID levels. BAC is already over-capitalized, so the impact of Basel III Endgame rules, which will raise equity capital requirements by 20%, will be less significant. With a Price/Tangible Book Value of 1.15x, BAC shares have a normalized P/E of 8.5x. The dividend yield is 3.5%, and forecasts indicate a total return of 91% by the end of 2026. The investment case for BAC is based on its ability to maintain a low-teens long-term ROTCE on a growing capital base."

However, this pattern needs confirmation. Second, sentiment is becoming bearish, which is interesting considering the upcoming seasonal upshift in flows. Third, stocks appear stretched compared to bonds in terms of price and value. Fourth, equity market valuations are behaving unusually, raising questions about whether this time is different. Fifth, gold miners are cheaper than energy stocks. Overall, there are important \"lines in the sand\" forming for markets, with bullish evidence for the short-term outlook, but risks are also building up. Additionally, the Consensus Inc sentiment indicator dropping below 50% suggests that historically, this has favored the bulls. The seasonal pattern of fund flows indicates that November is typically a strong month. Defensive stocks have been hit hard, potentially signaling a contrarian opportunity. Stocks have had a remarkable run compared to corporate bonds since 2009, but they are now overbought at resistance. Stocks are also expensive compared to bonds and history, while bonds are relatively cheap. Lastly, microcap returns are experiencing drawdowns similar to 2020 levels, except for big tech."

The ZEW survey respondents and a majority of fund managers surveyed believe that bond yields will be lower in the future. The correlation between the copper vs gold ratio and US 10-year bond yields seems to be suffering due to the pandemic's supply and stimulus shocks. Another infirm correlation is between US 10-year yields and developed market manufacturing PMIs. The search for yield theme has reversed, with cash providing greater yield than traditional yield-oriented assets. The question arises whether higher interest rates can be the cure for higher interest rates, considering the impact on valuations in real estate and equity markets."

        "summary": "The cost of capital is increasing as baby boomers retire and invest in more conservative assets, leading to markdowns in the private tech market. Startup costs have significantly decreased due to SaaS tools, cloud services, and new distribution platforms, allowing founders to build products with as little as $50-100k. This shift in startup costs has implications for the VC industry, with a move towards bootstrapping and profitability becoming more popular. The VC industry is expected to become more barbell-shaped, with big funds on one end and small, specialized funds on the other. The middle ground will struggle to survive. The restructuring of the VC industry will also lead to a consolidation into three distinct segments: traditional artisanal approach, specialization in B2B SaaS startups, and a shift towards private equity-like investments. Small funds are expected to thrive in this new landscape. The dilution of seed investors' returns in later funding rounds highlights the importance of building a profitable business early on. Overall, this is an exciting time for startups and venture capital as a new Renaissance emerges in Silicon Valley."

They examine the health of the US consumer, large and small companies, global trends, and the relationship between equities and bonds. The analysis reveals that several important trends have been broken, indicating potential weakness in the US economy. The author attributes this to the rapid rise in US long-term Treasury yields, which is causing liquidity to be drawn out of asset markets. They suggest that this shift in the bond market could lead to a self-reinforcing downward spiral in both financial markets and the real economy. The author remains cautious and recommends holding interest-paying cash and buying puts on any equity rally until a significant low is reached. They also anticipate that the Federal Reserve may change its policy to provide additional liquidity to the markets. However, they acknowledge that their analysis may be subject to biases and uncertainties."

        "summarized_date": "2023-10-20",
        "summary": "US real rates have reached their highest level in 15 years, and understanding why is crucial for those following the economy and capital markets. Real rates are the yield paid on government bonds after inflation is deducted. Currently, the US is experiencing both strong economic growth and a high government budget deficit, leading to an increase in Treasury bond issuance. The main drivers of real rates are economic growth, which is influenced by an expanding labor force and improving productivity. Demographics pose a headwind for real growth, as the long-term trend is down, but there is still a large reservoir of employable people outside the labor force. Productivity is typically low during inflationary periods, but the potential impact of AI could provide a boost from 2025 onwards. The high levels of private sector debt following the Great Financial Crisis drove real rates below zero, but currently, large parts of the US economy have no leverage issue. Overall, the current economic context suggests that real rates are too high, and a significant downside move in equities may be on the horizon."

Despite the clear edge in the game, few players were able to maximize their winnings. Haghani found that players often over-bet, under-bet, and bet on tails, indicating a lack of understanding of position sizing. Position sizing is critical in portfolio management, as correctly sizing picks is more important than identifying good investments. Haghani's experiment highlights the importance of understanding risk and position sizing in finance and gambling. Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of crypto exchange FTX, also had a skewed risk perception, as he believed in going big even if it meant a high chance of going bust. However, this approach is not sustainable in the long run. Bankman-Fried's miscalibrated risk engine led him astray, and his risk preferences made it likely that he would go bust quickly. Overall, understanding risk and position sizing is crucial for success in finance and gambling."

Built in 1916, it initially attracted tenants easily but changed ownership multiple times. In 2022, the current owner, RXR Realty, stopped making loan payments to Aareal Bank and went into default. The bank has hired Jones Lang LaSalle to sell the loan at a discount, offering investors an opportunity for capital appreciation. The building's occupancy has dropped to 58% due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and attempts to attract tenants with discounted rents have been unsuccessful. Repurposing the building for residential use would lower its value significantly. Aareal Bank, with its experience in the real estate industry, has increased its loan loss provisions to absorb the financial hit from 61 Broadway. The bank remains optimistic, recognizing the cyclical nature of the real estate business."

The COVID-19 pandemic initially benefited the company as people stocked up on essential items and purchased furniture while in quarantine. However, the company's financial situation has worsened, with declining sales, increased SG&A expenses, and decreasing gross margins due to higher freight costs and inflationary pressures. Despite efforts to improve its balance sheet in FY'20, the company's total debt has skyrocketed to $504.4 million by the end of 2Q'23. To address its liquidity issues, Big Lots has engaged in sale-leaseback transactions, with the latest involving its distribution center in California and 22 store locations, generating net proceeds of approximately $294 million. The company plans to use the proceeds to pay off its debt. However, with limited remaining owned stores and distribution centers, the company may need to explore other options, such as operational improvements or equity dilution, to secure liquidity."

A former LifeStance employee raised similar concerns about erroneous billing and scheduling visits that were not made. Some customers have been charged cancellation fees for appointments that LifeStance cancels. The allegations raise questions about whether LifeStance is a legitimate therapy franchise or an illegal billing operation."

        "summary": "Private equity firm Blackstone has seen continued growth in assets under management (AUM), leading some to consider it a good investment. However, the theory that rising interest rates would negatively impact private equity seems to be playing out, as publicly reported commitments to private equity have fallen significantly. Despite this, Blackstone recently closed a $30 billion fund, suggesting a lag in money flows. It is important to note that there is a difference between total AUM and fee-earning AUM, with real estate being a significant portion of the latter. Blackstone has been aggressively pursuing the acquisition of listed real estate investment trusts (REITs) and making them private, allowing them to charge performance fees. However, the performance of listed apartment REITs and slowing flows to the private equity sector may put financial pressure on Blackstone's permanent capital structures. Despite rising interest rates, the stability of collateral values, such as rising US house prices, has helped support Blackstone's AUM. However, a short position on Blackstone may be advisable if inflation and interest rates continue to rise or collateral values start to fall."

        "summary": "The author of the article sees an opportunity for a fund based on the belief that politics is moving towards being pro-labour and away from pro-capital. This leads to a bullish outlook on wages and real assets, and a bearish outlook on financial assets. The author suggests going long on gold (GLD) and short on long-dated treasuries (TLT) as a way to express this view. The author also suggests going long on high-yield bonds (HYG) and short on TLT for those who don't like the negative carry of the GLD/TLT idea. In a pro-labour world, regulations and tariffs are necessary to protect domestic wages, making devaluing the currency unnecessary. This means that foreigners are no longer the main buyers of treasuries, and locals are buying them instead. The author notes that the S&P 500 has held up well against gold, but a short portfolio of bond proxies and businesses that don't work at interest rates above 7% could be profitable."

Stock markets have fallen, with the Mexican peso experiencing significant losses. Dollar bonds issued by Middle Eastern sovereigns have also performed poorly. Oil prices have surged above $90 per barrel as Iran calls for an embargo against Israel, leading to concerns about further escalation of the conflict. Despite this, some Asian assets briefly rallied after positive Chinese growth data, but the gains were short-lived. India is seen as the next big emerging market growth story, with its strong GDP growth and stock market performance. The country's growth is attributed to improvements in basic infrastructure and favorable demographics. India's working-age population is expected to rise, offsetting issues with female labor force participation and underemployment. Transsion, a Chinese smartphone maker, is experiencing growth and increased market share in emerging markets, particularly Africa. It is the only top-five smartphone vendor to gain market share in the third quarter. South Korea is projected to become the world's seventh-largest economy by 2040, with a focus on high-tech industries.

Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted from his position after a motion to remove him was brought by a conservative member and every Democrat voted against him. McCarthy's removal came after House conservatives feared he had cut a side deal with President Biden on Ukraine funding. The war in Ukraine is not going well, and conservative opposition to sending more military assistance is growing. This poses a challenge for the Biden administration as it heads into an election year. The situation in the Middle East, with the assault by Hamas on Israel, further complicates matters. Funding for Ukraine is running dry, and the pressure on the situation is increasing. The Biden administration is considering linking Ukraine funding to aid for Israel in an attempt to increase the chances of Congress approving aid to Kyiv. However, the situation remains fluid, and much depends on how quickly Republicans can settle on a new speaker and how strongly conservatives oppose Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russian President Putin has blamed the US for the violence in Israel and warned of conflict expansion. In the midst of these events, a natural gas pipeline connecting Finland to Estonia has been severely damaged, possibly due to sabotage. The situation raises questions about Putin's intentions and the potential for further escalation."

However, a closer look reveals that Uruguay still relies on fossil fuels during periods of drought and that hydroelectric dams play a significant role in its renewable energy mix. The country's small population and relatively low GDP per capita also make its situation less applicable to larger, wealthier nations. Additionally, Uruguay's high consumption of beef contributes significantly to its carbon footprint. The article argues that Uruguay's experience highlights the limitations and challenges of achieving a fully renewable electricity grid, including the need for backup power and the environmental impact of large-scale dams. It suggests that the country's story should be viewed with nuance and caution, rather than as a blueprint for other nations."

Originally a military fort, it became a haven for refugees and squatters, eventually growing into a self-contained city with its own economy and social structure. The Walled City was notorious for its cramped living conditions, lack of sanitation, and rampant crime. However, it also had a vibrant community and a unique architectural style, with buildings stacked on top of each other and interconnected by a maze of narrow alleyways. Despite its reputation, the Walled City had a surprisingly low crime rate and a strong sense of community. The demolition of the Walled City was met with mixed reactions, with some residents mourning the loss of their homes and others relieved to escape the squalor. Today, the site of the Walled City has been transformed into a park, but its legacy lives on as a symbol of urban chaos and resilience."

        "summary": "Global debt has reached a record high of $397 trillion in the first half of 2023, according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF). This increase in debt comes despite tightening credit conditions and is a cause for concern as artificially low interest rates are no longer sustainable. Developed nations, including Japan, the US, Britain, and France, accounted for about 80% of the new global debt, while emerging markets such as China, Brazil, and India also saw significant increases. The IIF warns that as interest rates rise and debt levels increase, domestic debt strains will also rise. The US government alone is over $33 trillion in debt, and interest payments on the debt now match national defense spending. The global economy, which has relied on easy money and low interest rates, is now facing the challenge of higher rates that could potentially break the borrow-and-spend economy. The CPI may show a cooling of inflation, but rising prices are still a concern for Americans. Peter Schiff, an economist, argues that the government is not being honest about inflation, and people are struggling with higher costs of living. To protect themselves, Schiff suggests investing in assets such as gold and silver and divesting from the US dollar."

However, this claim is not true, as it fails to consider the military goals and the potential costs of these conflicts. In the case of Israel, the goal is not just to prevent Hamas attacks, but to overwhelmingly defeat the movement and kill or capture its leadership. This could be a costly and difficult task, as Hamas has hidden resources and uses an unmapped tunnel system. Similarly, Ukraine's goal is to drive Russian forces out of occupied territories, but the campaign has resulted in heavy casualties and equipment losses without significant territorial gains. Funding these wars would place a heavy financial burden on the American people, who are already facing economic challenges such as dwindling savings, high inflation, and record-high debt. The current monetary system may create the illusion that the government can solve global problems without raising taxes, but in reality, the cost is borne by the public through inflation."

The US had been focused on building Israel's diplomatic bridges and diverting attention away from the Palestinian cause, but Hamas' actions have brought the issue back to the forefront. The article argues that blaming Iranian support for Hamas misses the point of the deep-rooted Palestinian grievances. China's failure to criticize Hamas has shocked the West, but other parts of the world may have a better understanding of the conflict's history. The renewed US focus on the Middle East could divert attention and resources from other global issues.

        "summary": "The conflict between Hamas and Israel, which has resulted in over 1,100 deaths, is causing concerns of a wider regional conflagration. The conflict is the deadliest and most sophisticated since the Yom Kippur War 50 years ago and is shaking the entire Middle East. It is also impacting the Biden administration's plans to counter Chinese and Russian influence in the region. The US has been a key supporter of Israel, providing annual aid of $3.3 billion, making it the largest recipient of US aid since World War II. However, this aid is now causing condemnation of both Washington and Jerusalem in Middle Eastern capitals. The recent diplomatic forays of China and Russia into the region, particularly their success in normalizing Iran-Saudi and Saudi-Syria ties, have prompted the US to seek normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel through the Abraham Accords. However, the Saudis have been difficult to bargain with, and the conflict between Hamas and Israel has further complicated the situation. The conflict is also benefiting Iran, as it pushes Saudi Arabia away from normalization. If the war continues and results in heavy casualties among Palestinians, it will shelve the Saudi-Israel deal and affect Washington's plans to reshape the Middle East."

Abalos's goal was to remove corrupt and ineffective officers from the force, but the resistance from these officers highlights the challenges in reforming the police force.

Despite the political divisions, the cultural similarities between the two countries, including religion, food, customs, music, and movies, unite them. Cricket is a particularly unifying factor, with both Indian and Pakistani fans showing support for each other's teams. The match is expected to draw a massive audience, with half a billion people watching online and the world's largest cricket stadium, Narendra Modi stadium in Ahmedabad, packed to capacity. The demand for tickets and accommodations has skyrocketed, with fans even checking into hospitals near the stadium due to the lack of available hotels. The match holds great significance for both nations, and for the next 24 hours, it will be the center of attention for India and Pakistan."

This decision is seen as a signal that President Joko Widodo's oldest son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, will be a running mate, potentially establishing a family dynasty. The relationship between President Widodo and his party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP), is unclear following his support for Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto, who ran against Widodo in previous elections. The court's decision has been criticized for favoring Gibran and is seen as an indication of political interests influencing election regulations. With the approaching registration period for the general election, tensions are rising, and there are reports of a breakdown in relations between Widodo and the PDIP. Analysts believe that Widodo's support for Prabowo is aimed at securing his political future and protecting his legacy. If rumors of Gibran accompanying Prabowo come true, the PDIP is expected to double its efforts to defeat them in the election."

        "summary": "China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has gained momentum and global support, contrasting with the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. The BRI forum, attended by representatives from 130 countries, has showcased China's alternative approach to conflict resolution and economic development. China has made crucial modifications to the BRI, shifting its focus towards services and the digital world. This includes an emphasis on e-commerce, investment protection treaties, standardized trade rules, and green development. The rebranding of the BRI aims to address Western criticism and present China as a responsible economic player. China's openness to foreign investment and removal of restrictions further positions it as an attractive partner for global corporations and governments. In contrast, Washington-supported plans like the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) pale in comparison to the renewed BRI. Ongoing conflicts and Washington's uncritical support for Israel may also impact the viability of these plans. China's revival of the BRI comes at an opportune time for Beijing, while posing challenges for Washington."

        "summary": "China is expected to tighten its funding for Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects in the coming years, despite President Xi Jinping's promise to maintain funding at the recent Belt and Road Forum. Analysts predict that China will focus on quality over quantity and prioritize projects that are economically viable and have a positive impact on local communities. This shift in approach is driven by concerns over debt sustainability and the need to address criticism of the BRI's environmental and social impact. China is also likely to increase its scrutiny of potential borrowers and prioritize countries with stable political environments and strong governance. The tightening of funding is expected to affect countries that have already received significant BRI investments, as well as those seeking future funding. However, China will continue to support projects that align with its strategic interests, such as infrastructure development and connectivity initiatives."

Unlike the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, Novavax's vaccine contains a coronavirus protein that stimulates the immune system. The company has found a way to produce the vaccine using moth cells, allowing for faster manufacturing. The Novavax vaccine has been shown to provide 50% protection against symptomatic disease in fully vaccinated individuals, according to an Italian study. It is available for anyone 12 years and older, including those who have previously received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. Distribution of the vaccine will take time, but it will eventually be available at 13,000 stores. There is some evidence that mixing the Novavax vaccine with an mRNA vaccine may be immunologically better, but more research is needed. Novavax has also been found to have fewer side effects compared to mRNA vaccines."

COVID-19 metrics, including wastewater, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations, are declining, following the usual seasonal trend. Hospitalizations for COVID-19 are lower than in previous years due to population-level immunity. The Omicron variant is expected to drive the winter surge, with the BA.2.86 variant showing a growth advantage and FLiP mutations gaining ground. Influenza levels are very low, with one strain, Yamagata influenza B, going extinct due to COVID-19 measures. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is picking up, particularly in the South, signaling the start of the RSV season. Excess mortality is above pre-pandemic levels. Vaccination rates for COVID-19 and flu are still uncertain, with 2% of the eligible population estimated to have received their fall COVID-19 vaccine. It is recommended to get vaccinated before Halloween and to wear masks when ILI levels reach epidemic levels."

        "summary": "Vicarious trauma, the psychological impact of second-hand exposure to traumatic events, can have long-lasting effects on mental health. The extent of suffering depends on the dose of exposure and socio-demographic factors. Media exposure, especially through social media and television, can worsen the impact of traumatic events. Studies have shown that heavy social media use after such events can lead to an excess mental health service burden. Certain socio-demographic groups, such as those who share a social identity with the victims or have experienced pre-event trauma, are at higher risk of experiencing vicarious trauma. To reduce the impact of vicarious trauma, individuals can turn off auto-play videos on social media, take breaks from social media, pay attention to their emotions, seek social support, talk to someone they trust, find ways to feel useful, and monitor children's exposure to media. It is important to recognize the collective trauma caused by witnessing terrorist attacks and war and to seek support when feeling overwhelmed."

Torres highlighted that many emerging markets resemble the American markets in the 1930s, with inefficiencies and uncertainty, making them a fertile ground for value investing. He emphasized the importance of reducing Type 1 errors to improve investment performance and discussed the unique political risks of investing in China. Torres also touched on the underperformance of value investing and emerging markets in the past decade and the challenge of valuing companies with exponential growth potential. He advised investors to stay on the right side of information asymmetries and protect their portfolios from existential risks. Torres emphasized that not all emerging markets are created equal and discussed the importance of screening for stocks in these markets. He also highlighted the need for emerging market investors to have English accounts and to be comfortable with International Financial Reporting Standards. Overall, Torres provided valuable insights and advice for investors looking to navigate the complexities of value investing in emerging markets."

The initiative was inspired by the founder's own experience with mental health after becoming a father. The fund operates by taking a portion of the newsletter's proceeds and directly giving it to dads in need. However, the process has faced challenges, including difficulties in raising awareness and reaching out to dads who require support. Additionally, the complexity of the US medical system has posed obstacles in finding therapists who can work with US-based clients. Despite these challenges, the therapy fund has already raised a significant amount of money and has helped more dads this year compared to the previous year. The New Fatherhood encourages readers to contribute to the fund by becoming paid subscribers, with their subscription fees going towards helping dads in need."

        "summary": "Real estate is a popular outlet for savings, but there is skepticism about whether the stock market can replace it due to its complexity and unfamiliarity. However, there is a need to find an alternative to real estate, as it accounts for a significant portion of annual economic activity. Constraints such as affordability and leverage prevent real estate from becoming too hot, as it could lead to a major economic and social crisis. In China, the real estate market has become the center of the economy, with local governments benefiting from land sales and families investing in apartments. However, the reliance on real estate has led to a conundrum, as stopping the process of rising prices would cause tremendous pain throughout the economy. The resolution of this issue is expected to be time-consuming and uncertain. Distressed-debt investors who bought bonds from Evergrande, a Chinese real estate company, are realizing that the restructuring process will be overseen by the government and depend on its future plans for the firm."

However, the travel economy is still recovering, and the future of China's outbound travel remains uncertain. Chinese brands have excelled at marketing to Chinese consumers, operating at a speed that is hard to match. Chinese social media plays a significant role in driving the quest for new travel experiences, with user-generated content trusted more than brand-created content. China's high-speed rail network has become pivotal in trip planning and destination marketing, attracting younger travelers and offering appealing onboard services. China also has a unique take on over-tourism, with some destinations becoming overrun during Golden Week. South East Asian destinations, which heavily rely on Chinese tourists, have had to manage their expectations due to decreased international air capacity and gradual demand. It is important for destinations and travel suppliers to avoid over-emphasizing the three Golden Weeks and instead focus on year-round opportunities."

Deep Sail focuses on microcaps, special situations, and quality growth on the long side, and potential frauds, pump and dumps, and fads on the short side. Westropp explains that the \"right ponds\" for the fund are industries with high returns on capital invested, stable growth trajectories, high barriers to entry, and little commodity exposure. He also outlines the four pillars of an exceptional investment that the fund uses to evaluate potential investments. In terms of managing the short book, Westropp emphasizes the importance of valuation and sets criteria for short positions, such as avoiding companies with a short-borrow rate above 30%. He also highlights IPO hangovers, industry bubbles, pump and dumps, and growth deceleration as areas to look for short opportunities. Westropp concludes by discussing how Deep Sail Capital finds off-the-beaten-path ideas through a mix of screeners, investor networks, Twitter, and thematic-driven ideas.

The spirits segment has solid pricing power and good returns on capital. The non-alcoholic segment represents a smaller portion of revenue, with the Mio Mio brand being the growth driver. Mio Mio is a mate soft drink that is growing rapidly. The company has reduced its low-margin contract bottling business and is focusing on its owned brands and private labels. Berentzen also has a segment for fresh fruit machines, which has been stable but not impressive in terms of growth. The company also has other smaller segments, such as a museum experience and sales to the tourism industry in Turkey.

The author believes that the market has been slow to recognize this change and continues to price these cases as coin flips, presenting ongoing investment opportunities. They mention several potential opportunities, including Seagen, Albertson, iRobot, and Spirit Airlines, and emphasize the need for careful analysis of each individual case and the broader regulatory landscape.

        "summary": "Saga Furs, an auction house that sells furs, offers an opportunity to buy a business at a low valuation with a clear catalyst for growth. The largest competitor, Kopenhagen Fur, is set to liquidate in 2025, potentially allowing Saga Furs to gain market share. Saga Furs generates revenue through commissions charged to farmers and buyers at their auctions, as well as interest income from delayed payments. The company has historically struggled with negative earnings due to low fur prices and fixed costs, but higher sales could unlock operating leverage. The correlation between fur prices and Saga Furs' profit suggests that prices may rise in 2024. The author predicts that Saga Furs could take a significant portion of Kopenhagen Fur's market share and potentially achieve a monopolistic position. The company's clean balance sheet, with ample cash and little debt, and its asset-light business model further support its investment potential. While future earnings and price targets are uncertain, the author believes that buying Saga Furs at a low valuation presents a low-risk opportunity for potential profit."

        "summary": "Vita Coco, a leading coconut water brand, has released its 2022 shareholder letter, emphasizing the need for beverages to offer more than just refreshment. The company's founders, Michael Kirban and Ira Liran, recognized the untapped potential of the coconut water market in the US in 2003 and established a strong supply chain by partnering with coconut product manufacturers in various countries. Despite facing competition from industry giants like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, Vita Coco has emerged as the category leader in the US, with approximately 50% market share. The company has also expanded its focus to serve private label demand, particularly from Costco, which accounts for about 30% of its sales. However, Vita Coco recently announced the transition of its supply relationship with its largest private label customer, which is believed to be Costco. This development raises concerns about the long-term differentiation of Vita Coco's brand from private label offerings. The financial implications of this transition have not been quantified, but it is estimated to be around $50 million per year. Despite this setback, Vita Coco remains a dominant player in the coconut water market, which has grown to nearly $700 million in annual retail sales in the US."

The CEO, Jeff Brown, has announced his resignation, adding to the concerns about the company's performance. Despite these difficulties, Ally's deposit gathering franchise remains strong, with retail deposits crossing $140 billion in Q3 FY23. The company has added over 300,000 net new retail deposit customers this year. However, the interest rate environment has led to increased deposit costs, putting pressure on NIM. In Q3 FY23, deposit costs were around 4.0%, up 250 basis points from the previous year. The NIM contracted by over 50 basis points YoY, impacting short-term earnings. Ally's credit performance has also been affected, with retail auto net charge-offs increasing to 1.85% in Q3. Despite these challenges, management expects NIM to stabilize and gradually expand in the future."

Brent oil has broken the downtrend channel and reached a significant resistance level. The outlook for crude oil is consolidation before moving higher. A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that a 10% increase in natural gas prices can lead to a 0.2% increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The article also provides outlooks for natural gas and WTI oil. Natural gas shows signs of a potential rally in the near term, while WTI oil is likely to consolidate and retreat from current levels. The article concludes that the outlook for oil and gas is bullish in the short term, but there are factors that could keep prices rangebound. Natural gas is becoming more attractive, and there is potential for upside in the coming months."

        "summary": "Gold and silver prices are at risk of significant declines as real yields break out to new highs. The recent strength in gold was due to US regional bank failures and speculation of a higher China premium to global prices. However, even a partial catch-up with real yields could lead to a decline in precious metals. Silver, in particular, is at risk of a sharp decline as it no longer has a high correlation to gold and has industrial uses. The article suggests that if the gold triangle pattern break is verified, there could be meaningful declines in precious metals. The base case price target for gold is $1,700. For silver, if the bear flag thesis is correct, prices should break below $22.15 and gain momentum, with a price target of $15.25. The article also mentions that gold volatility has recently moved sharply and may need a pause before heading higher. Overall, the divergence between gold and real yields suggests that gold may need to catch up in the future."

        "summary": "The Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board have kept their interest rates unchanged, but the reactions in the bond market have been different. The UK Gilt yield curve has bull steepened, while the US yield curve has bear steepened. The British pound has weakened against the Euro and US Dollar, indicating that market participants are unwinding their positions in rates and currencies. Short positions against Gilts were likely curve trades against European bonds. The market suggests a sharp UK slowdown in the short term as the likely outcome. The US Friday reversal may well create a softening in yield in the short term, but it is likely a pause for yet higher yields. Two out of three key US equity indices confirm an H&S pattern. The Russell 2000 and S&P 500 have broken their H&S patterns, while the Nasdaq 100 is at crucial support. The UK Gilt yields are close to breaking down, especially in the curve's 2- and 5-year parts. The oversold momentum indicators are the only things going for the British Pound (GBP), which is insufficient to call for a sustainable bounce. The sharp move in yields last week should be seen in a near one-year consolidation pattern in 10- and 30-year yields. A bond bid due to an equity selloff is unlikely if the decline is measured and not unruly. A 35-year bond bull market unwinds will never be sideways, nor will it end when most think it has fallen too far and cannot fall much further."

Goldin is recognized as one of the pioneers of the \"credibility revolution\" in empirical economics, which focuses on using natural experiments to test hypotheses. Her research has shown the impact of technological innovations, such as the birth control pill, on women's careers and marriage decisions. Goldin's methodology is broad and eclectic, incorporating theories, cultural norms, politics, and economic history. She has created new data sets and uncovered trends in women's employment, highlighting the complex factors that influence women's economic situation. While progress has been made in reducing gender inequalities, Goldin's research also shows that women still face a tradeoff between child-rearing and careers. She suggests that remote work could be a solution to advancing gender equality by providing more flexibility in the workplace. Goldin's work demonstrates the power of understanding social problems at their functional level and using knowledge to reshape the world."

The article then discusses the recent reemergence of acute shortages in the global economy, caused by overwhelming demand and supply-side constraints. It highlights the role of monetary policy in addressing these shortages and the need for a balance between tightening policy to harden firms' budget constraints and hoping for supply-side capacity to return. The article also discusses the easing of supply constraints in various sectors, such as advanced manufacturing, energy, and food production, leading to increased output and stabilization of prices. It emphasizes that the stabilization in prices has primarily come from improvements in supply rather than contractions in demand. The article concludes by noting the importance of hardening global budget constraints to end the shortage economy and the need for central banks to prevent runaway price increases."

However, despite export controls and financial sanctions, Russia has been able to import what it needs for its military from the same countries that are supporting Ukraine. Russia's imports of manufactured goods have rebounded and remained steady, with exports from the EU and other democracies being routed through third countries. The Russian government initially restricted the data it published on imports, but has now resumed publishing monthly data. This is a serious problem as many exports going to Russia are coming from the allied democracies, including sophisticated machine tools necessary for military equipment. Extreme sanctions on Russian oil and gas exports have also proven ineffective, as the Russian government does not pay for anything using oil and gas, but rather relies on the ability to tap into the resources of productive societies through imports. Limiting the revenues from oil and gas exports is not enough to defend Ukraine as long as manufacturers continue to supply the Russian military industry with necessary equipment and components."

However, recent data suggests that the surplus has shrunk to an average of $14 billion per quarter in 2023. Despite the decrease in the surplus, there is still a discrepancy between Russian and non-Russian data, making it difficult to interpret the situation accurately. Capital flight is believed to be the main reason for the financial outflows from Russia since the start of the war."

The article highlights the massive unmet energy needs of the global population and the potential for growth in both new technologies and traditional energy sources. However, there is a lack of calls for oil and gas companies to increase capital expenditure, and the decline in New Energies equities suggests slower growth in that sector. The article also mentions rising tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, which could impact OPEC spare capacity and energy commodity prices. The traditional energy sector is seen as under-appreciated, and there may be value in some New Energies equities in the future. Overall, the article emphasizes the need to consider both geopolitical risks and the energy transition when analyzing the energy sector."

However, this high multiple is due to the company's low estimated earnings, not its valuation. The P/E multiple is a useful piece of information when combined with a sense of the trajectory of earnings, but it has limitations. It does not determine whether a stock is attractive on its own. Factors such as the growth potential of the business and external influences need to be considered. The P/E multiple is a rule of thumb and should be used as a marker of expectations rather than valuation. It provides a starting point for research, but it's up to the individual investor to determine if the market's expectations are accurate. Low P/E stocks have historically underperformed high P/E stocks, but there is no one right answer in any environment. Investors should conduct their own research and make decisions based on their analysis."

The impact of these drugs extends beyond the pharmaceutical industry, affecting equity valuations and cash flows. The drugs' potential to create significant weight loss has led to a sell-off in food and beverage manufacturers, as well as alcohol purveyors. Investors are also considering the second- and third-order effects of these drugs, such as the potential increase in retail sales as patients on Ozempic require new wardrobes. The drugs' impact on consumer behavior and the market is significant, particularly considering the importance of \"super consumers\" who drive a large portion of sales for certain industries. However, there are concerns about the long-term effectiveness of GLP-1 drugs and potential side effects. Despite this, there is optimism that GLP-1s could have a transformative effect on society, similar to the birth control pill."

Supporters of the 70-year-old economist have organized a \"National Townhall for Justice Roadshow\" to advocate for a royal pardon. However, it is unlikely that Najib can be pardoned unless his other court cases are dismissed. Despite being in jail, Najib remains a powerful political figure and is believed to control a significant amount of political funds. Many fear that without him, Malaysia could fall into the hands of Islamist fundamentalists. However, it is important to remember Najib's involvement in corruption and other crimes. Police found a massive amount of stolen wealth, including jewelry, handbags, and cash, at his residence. He is also accused of ordering the murder of a former lover who knew too much about the 1MDB scandal. If Najib is pardoned, he could potentially regain power and continue his corrupt practices."

The author questions who made the decision for Hamas to go to war and suggests that they may have received instructions from the Muslim Brotherhood in Qatar or Iran. The article argues that Hamas has no chance of victory against Israel, as Israel has a much larger military and controls essential resources like water, food, and electricity in Gaza. The author speculates that Hamas may have started the war to gain financial support and remind the world of its existence. The article concludes by suggesting that the conflict in the Middle East will continue for decades due to the competing interests of Iran, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states, and criticizes the region's leaders as being \"insane.\""

Hezbollah operatives are provided with state-sponsored cover identities and access to Venezuela's airline and banking systems, allowing them to move freely in the Western Hemisphere. The influx of Venezuelans crossing the US southern border provides an opportunity for Hezbollah operatives to infiltrate the country. Hezbollah is known for its long-term planning and stockpiling of explosives, as well as cultivating contacts for firearms. They have also created target packages on potential targets in cities like New York, Chicago, and Washington, D.C.

The SJP is also connected to the American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), an organization whose leaders include former Islamic terrorists. The article argues that these radical leftist groups, including SJP, are not simply protesting but explicitly calling for violence and destruction in solidarity with Hamas. Law enforcement agencies across the US have gone on alert in response to the rising threat level, with enhanced security measures and increased patrols of Jewish houses of worship, Jewish-owned businesses, and Israeli diplomatic buildings.

Many Indigenous Australians also voted against 'The Voice' due to concerns about representation and the fear that it would be controlled by self-appointed activists. The article highlights the failure of the 'yes' campaign to address these concerns and the labeling of 'no' voters as racist. It also raises questions about the allocation of funds for Indigenous Australians and the lack of transparency and accountability. The article suggests that the defeat of 'The Voice' referendum may set back the cause of Indigenous Australians and calls for further investigation into corruption and the representation of Indigenous Australians.

Civil servants will receive incentives and increased pension payouts, which make up a significant portion of government expenditure. There is no effort to rein in public sector expenditure, raising concerns about productivity. The budget also includes plans for green initiatives, such as the use of solar panels and electric vehicles, but there are questions about the practicality and the need to import these technologies. The budget has faced criticism for using public funds for infrastructure projects and land purchases by government-linked companies.

        "summary": "There is speculation about the possibility of PAS joining a 'unity government' in Malaysia, which would include various ethnic and ideological interests. While this idea could be beneficial in terms of creating a broad coalition, it was previously rejected by Muhyiddin Yassin and Abdul Hadi Awang. If PAS were to join, the 'unity government' would have a super-majority in parliament. However, the substance of the government would not change significantly, as key policies would remain the same. The main issue in Malaysian politics is not ideological differences, but rather clashes between personalities. The constant changes in leadership have led to political instability. The 'unity government' could provide stability and clarity for Malaysians, but it needs PAS more than PAS needs it. PAS believes it can form a strong and stable government on its own after the next general election. The 'unity government' must now strategize to maintain power in the upcoming election."

        "summary": "China is working to make the rest of the world dependent on it for solar, wind, and lithium supply chains, which could pose a problem if access to Chinese suppliers is cut off. Western wind power companies like Siemens Gamesa are being forced to pull back and outsource production to lower-cost suppliers, many of which are in China. This could lead to a loss of control over crucial infrastructure if Chinese suppliers become inaccessible. The rest of the world should be wary of becoming dependent on China for these supplies, as it would be difficult and costly to regain manufacturing expertise and capacity if access is lost. In other news, Microsoft is reportedly close to unveiling its Athena AI Accelerator Chip, which it has been developing since 2019. The chip is expected to compete with Nvidia's offerings and could provide benefits for hyperscalers by reducing costs and increasing control over hardware. Nvidia, on the other hand, is attempting to reduce its reliance on hyperscalers by building its own cloud service and leasing data center space. However, regulators' attacks on Big Tech are seen as unsavory, and there is a need for a substantive debate on how to best deal with the power amassed by these companies. Finally, high-skilled immigration is highlighted as a policy lever for innovation, with immigrants representing a significant portion of Nobel Prize winners in the US."

The report highlights the growth potential of the dollar store industry, which has been steadily taking share in retail for decades. Dollar stores offer a difficult-to-replicate value proposition that is insulated from e-commerce competition. Dollar Tree, in particular, has self-help opportunities to improve sales productivity and operating efficiency. The report also praises the management team, led by Chairman/CEO Rick Dreiling, who has a track record of success in the industry. The market is currently extrapolating recent issues at Dollar General to Dollar Tree, but the report argues that Dollar Tree is contributing to Dollar General's woes and is ahead in its investment cycle. The report concludes that Dollar Tree has an attractive return profile, with a target price range of $190-230/share and a 3-year IRR range of 23-30%."

        "summary": "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) communicates monetary policy through the federal funds rate, which is the rate for short-term lending and borrowing of central bank reserves in the U.S. The market for federal funds has changed since the global financial crisis, with a decrease in daily trading volume. The main borrowers in the fed funds market are the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks (FBO branches), while domestic banks also borrow but at smaller volumes. FBO branches borrow in the fed funds market because they have limited access to deposits and face lower borrowing costs compared to domestic banks. Domestic banks increase their borrowing when aggregate reserves decline. The main lenders in the fed funds market are the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), which lend to their members through collateralized loans. FHLBs hold liquidity portfolios and do not earn interest on their balances at the central bank, creating an incentive for them to lend at rates below the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate. Domestic depository institutions also lend in the fed funds market but at small volumes due to their ability to earn the IORB rate. Overall, the fed funds market has changed significantly since 2008, with the Fed's balance sheet expansion and the introduction of interest on reserve balances."

        "summarized_date": "2023-10-20",
        "summary": "Household saving rates in the United States and other high-income economies increased during the pandemic due to reduced spending and government income support. However, saving behavior has diverged since then, with the U.S. saving rate dropping below pre-pandemic levels while saving rates in other countries remain above pre-pandemic levels. As a result, U.S. consumers have been spending down their excess savings while excess savings in other countries remain untapped. This divergence helps explain why U.S. GDP has returned to its pre-pandemic trend path while GDP levels in other high-income economies remain below trend. The drawdown in U.S. excess savings has contributed to U.S. GDP growth, while weak consumer spending has acted as a drag on the recoveries of other countries. The reasons for this divergence in saving behavior are unclear, but it may be related to differences in the drivers of excess saving, such as unexpected income windfalls in the U.S. The spending down of excess savings in the U.S. has supported growth despite lagging real income and tighter financial conditions."

        "summary": "Large firms, including both domestic and multinational companies, generate positive total factor productivity (TFP) spillovers to their domestic suppliers, according to a study by Mary Amiti, C\u00e9dric Duprez, Jozef Konings, and John Van Reenen. The study, which used firm-to-firm transaction data for Belgian firms between 2002 and 2014, found that firms that started selling to a \"superstar\" firm experienced around 7 to 8 percent higher TFP than firms that did not have a relationship with a superstar firm. The spillovers were observed for all types of superstar firms, including large firms, multinationals, and exporters. The study also found that forming relationships with superstar firms led to increases in sales, intermediate inputs, labor, capital, and the number of buyers for supplier firms. The spillovers were attributed to factors such as the transfer of know-how, access to new networks of potential customers, and signaling effects. The findings suggest that allowing superstar firms to grow and form relationships with less successful firms can have advantages for the economy."

Black children are 50% more likely to be placed into foster care than white children who have the same potential for experiencing maltreatment if left at home. The study used a quasi-experimental approach to measure unwarranted racial disparities by examining the placement rates of case investigators in Michigan. The findings suggest that racial discrimination may be a factor in the disparities observed. However, it is also important to consider the risk of subsequent maltreatment when assessing the placement disparities. The study found that the disparities were driven by children who had a potential for maltreatment if left at home. The research also suggests that higher placement rates among Black children may offer protection to those at risk of maltreatment. The study highlights the need for policies that aim to reduce racial disparities in foster care placement and improve family well-being."

        "summary": "The article discusses the evolution of liquidity in the U.S. Treasury securities market in 2023. The market experienced a worsening of liquidity in March 2023 after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, but quickly improved to levels similar to the previous year. Liquidity in the market is important for various purposes, including financing the U.S. government, managing interest rate risk, and implementing monetary policy. The article examines three commonly used measures of liquidity: bid-ask spread, order book depth, and price impact. These measures indicate that liquidity worsened in March 2023 but returned to levels similar to the previous year within a month. The increase in volatility due to the failures of the banks explains the observed patterns in liquidity. The analysis also shows that liquidity in 2023 is consistent with the historical relationship between liquidity and volatility. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for continued vigilance and efforts to enhance the market's resilience."

        "summary": "Consumer spending in the US has been stronger than expected, with real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) growing faster than predicted. The strength of consumption can be attributed to factors such as the fast rollout of vaccines, larger-than-expected fiscal stimulus, and low interest rates. While there is uncertainty about the level of excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, a broader assessment of households' financial positions is more important than excess savings alone. The role of debt in supporting consumption is examined, with households benefiting from lower mortgage payments and cash-out refinances. Other forms of debt, such as student loans and credit cards, have also contributed to available funds for consumption. Indicators of households' financial health, such as delinquency rates and consumer expectations, suggest that the household sector is in a strong position. However, the end of very low interest rates and the resumption of student loan payments may tighten household finances in the future."

        "summary": "The end of the federal student loan payment pause has led to an analysis of borrower expectations regarding the impact of the payment resumption on future spending growth, credit delinquency, and the economy. The findings suggest that the resumption of payments will have a relatively small overall effect on consumption, with a 0.1 percentage point reduction in aggregate spending from August levels. Student loan delinquency rates are expected to return to pre-pandemic levels. Low-income borrowers, female borrowers, those with less than a bachelor's degree, and those who were not in repayment before the pandemic are more likely to expect missed student loan payments. The survey also reveals that enrollment in income-driven repayment (IDR) plans is expected to increase, particularly among low-income borrowers. Borrowers anticipate a decrease in average monthly spending of around $56 per month when payments resume. The likelihood of missing a student loan payment is higher for female borrowers and those with lower household incomes. However, expectations for missing non-student loan payments are more similar across groups. Overall, the impact of the payment resumption on consumption and delinquency is expected to be relatively modest, partly due to borrowers already adjusting their savings and consumption decisions in anticipation of the resumption."

        "summary": "China is unlikely to achieve its goal of reaching the per capita income of a mid-level developed country by 2035, according to economists Hunter L. Clark and Matthew Higgins. They argue that China's rapid growth is facing challenges such as population aging, diminishing returns to its investment-centered growth model, increased state management of the economy, credit issues in real estate, and limited access to foreign technologies. Even with generous assumptions about future growth, China is projected to close only a fraction of the income gap with high-income countries. The authors also highlight the constraints on China's future growth, including declining labor inputs due to population aging and diminishing returns to capital accumulation. They argue that achieving the necessary productivity growth to meet income goals is unlikely, given that China's productivity growth is already high and historical precedents show that very few countries have achieved such growth rates. Additionally, the authors point out the structural headwinds, such as state management of the economy, institutional development, the need to rebalance the economy, and high levels of private and government debt. The authors conclude that while China has strengths, such as a well-educated population and technological advancements, the odds of achieving the income growth target are stiff."

They argue that buybacks can be unpredictable and may not always increase shareholder value. The author prefers dividends because they provide a steady income and the option to reinvest the cash. They also highlight the importance of a company's history of both dividends and buybacks when analyzing investment opportunities. The article concludes by stating that while a consistent share buyback can be powerful and beneficial for dividend growth, it is not always the best capital allocation choice, and other factors such as reinvestment potential or acquisitions should also be considered."

        "summary": "Investors are continuing to pour money into US Treasuries, despite the fact that they are on track to produce negative returns for three consecutive years. This is atypical behavior, as investors typically flee asset classes that have been performing poorly. The inflow into long-duration Treasury Bond Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) has also been strong. However, if US Treasuries fail to respond to financial market stress, such as a plunge in stock prices, it could be a sign that they are losing their safe-haven status. The inability of US Treasuries to hold a brief price spurt due to recent events in Israel is not encouraging. Despite this, if US Treasuries were to surge to a yield of 6%, triggering a stock market correction, a bond market rally is likely to follow. However, the long-term outlook for US Treasuries remains bearish due to a torrent of supply and a lack of buyers. In the oil market, there has been a deep contraction in the number of Drilled, Uncompleted (DUC) wells, which is rarely discussed. This contraction has created a backlog of partially completed wells, and producers need to increase drilling activity to meet demand. The cautious consumer sentiment and deceleration in spending indicate a potential recession. Despite the current bullish sentiment in the financial media, there is a fear of missing out on the usual October rally."

The report suggests that natural gas prices in Europe and America have dropped significantly from their highs last year. G&R believes that U.S. natural gas is on the verge of an upside price explosion. The report also criticizes Vladimir Putin's stance on fracking, stating that it is ironic for him to criticize fracking's environmental impact while being willing to explore for oil in the Arctic shelf."

        "summary": "The US government is considering restrictions on open-source technologies, such as RISC-V and AI foundation models, in an attempt to prevent China from gaining access to American chip design IPs and AI capabilities. However, this move is seen as misguided and impractical, as open-source technologies are globally pervasive and restricting them would be nearly impossible. The winners in this situation would be big tech incumbents, as open AI models erode the profitability of proprietary models. Additionally, charlatan DC lawmakers who are capitalizing on the fear and confusion surrounding China and AI are also benefiting from this push to restrict open source. Ironically, these restrictions would actually benefit China by making its AI capabilities appear stronger than they actually are. Restricting open source would also have negative consequences, such as stifling innovation and collaboration, and wasting the talent and identity of programmers and developers, particularly in China. Ultimately, this move to restrict open source in the name of competition with China is undemocratic and goes against the values of transparency, openness, and collaboration that open source represents."

The rules will require notifications and licenses for a wider range of chips, including those from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel. The jurisdiction of the licensing requirement is expanding to all 22 countries with a US arms embargo to prevent China from obtaining banned chips from third countries. The rules also add two Chinese companies, Biren and Moore Thread, and their subsidiaries to the government entity list. The expanded ban is expected to stall China's AI progress and ambition, particularly in large-language-model-generative AI. American chip companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel will also be negatively affected as they derive a significant portion of their revenue from China."

        "summary": "Riot Platforms Inc., the largest publicly traded bitcoin miner, has been paid $31.7 million by Texas to shut down its operations during a heatwave in August. Riot operates the largest bitcoin mining facility in the world in Rockdale, Texas, and is in the process of constructing a second facility in Corsicana. The company's power trading strategy involves buying electricity at a fixed price and using it to mine bitcoin. If spot electricity prices are higher than what the company can earn by mining bitcoin, Riot can sell the electricity back into the market and take the spread. Riot's presence in Texas is argued to help the grid by promoting green energy and easing strain during peak demand periods. However, the company's strategy comes with tradeoffs, including a firm obligation to purchase a certain amount of electricity regardless of mining profitability and exposure to forward power prices. Riot's financial performance is highly correlated to the price of bitcoin, and falling bitcoin prices have led to significant margin pressure for the company."

The response from Israel will be crucial, as the violence has already had a significant impact. The conflict is unlikely to lead to reconciliation with Iran, which finances Palestinian terrorism along with Qatar. This is positive for the energy sector, as oil prices tend to rise during times of war, and for arms manufacturers, as military spending is expected to increase in the coming years. The stock markets have ended the week flat, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the situation. Bond yields have decreased due to increased geopolitical risks. The currency market has seen a return of flows to the US dollar, with the yen and Swiss franc performing well as defensive currencies. Natural gas prices have surged, and Chevron has temporarily halted production at one of its Israeli fields. The IMF has released new forecasts for the global economy, predicting a worsening of global growth, particularly in Europe and China. Inflation is expected to decrease globally, and there are concerns about China's financial stability due to the real estate crisis. The CPI in the US has come out slightly higher than expected, with energy costs decreasing. In Europe, there are some signs of improvement, but growth remains weak, especially in Germany. The upcoming week will provide important economic updates on growth and inflation in various countries. The quarterly reports of US banks have exceeded analysts' expectations, thanks to the strong US economy and rising interest rates."

The main borrowers in the fed funds market are the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks (FBO branches), while domestic banks also borrow but at smaller volumes. FBO branches borrow in the fed funds market because they have limited access to deposits and face lower borrowing costs compared to domestic banks. Domestic banks borrow more when aggregate reserves decline. The main lenders in the fed funds market are the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), which lend to their members through collateralized loans. FHLBs hold liquidity portfolios and do not earn interest on their balances at the central bank, creating an incentive for them to lend at rates below the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate. Domestic depository institutions also lend in the fed funds market but at small volumes due to their ability to earn the IORB rate."

        "summary": "Household saving rates in the United States and other high-income economies increased during the pandemic due to reduced spending and government income support. However, saving behavior has diverged since then, with the U.S. saving rate dropping below pre-pandemic levels while saving rates in other countries remain above pre-pandemic levels. As a result, U.S. consumers have been spending down their excess savings while foreign consumers have not. This divergence helps explain why U.S. GDP has returned to its pre-pandemic trend path while GDP levels in other high-income economies remain below trend. The drawdown in U.S. excess savings has contributed to the country's economic growth, while weak consumer spending has acted as a drag on the recoveries of foreign economies. The reasons for this divergence in saving behavior are unclear, but it may be related to differences in the drivers of excess saving, such as unexpected income windfalls in the U.S. The spending down of excess savings in the U.S. has supported growth despite lagging real income and tighter financial conditions."

The study, which used firm-to-firm transaction data for Belgian firms between 2002 and 2014, found that firms that started selling to a \"superstar\" firm experienced around 7 to 8 percent higher TFP than firms that did not have a relationship with a superstar firm. The spillovers were observed for all types of superstar firms, including large firms, multinationals, and exporters. The study also found that forming relationships with superstar firms led to increases in sales, intermediate inputs, labor, capital, and the number of buyers for supplier firms. The spillovers were attributed to factors such as the transfer of know-how, access to new networks of potential customers, and signaling effects. The findings suggest that allowing superstar firms to grow and form relationships with less successful firms can have advantages for the economy."

The study used a quasi-experimental approach to measure unwarranted racial disparities by examining the placement rates of case investigators in Michigan. The findings suggest that racial discrimination may be a factor in the disparities observed. However, it is also important to consider the risk of subsequent maltreatment when assessing these disparities. The study found that the disparities were driven by children who had a potential for maltreatment if left at home. The research also suggests that higher placement rates among Black children may offer protection to those at risk of maltreatment. The study highlights the need for policies that aim to reduce racial disparities in foster care placement while also improving family well-being."

The market experienced a worsening of liquidity in March 2023 after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, but quickly improved to levels similar to the previous year. Liquidity in the market is important for various purposes, including financing the U.S. government, managing interest rate risk, and implementing monetary policy. The article examines three commonly used measures of liquidity: bid-ask spread, order book depth, and price impact. These measures indicate that liquidity worsened in March 2023 but returned to levels similar to the previous year within a month. The increase in volatility due to the failures of the banks explains the observed patterns in liquidity. The analysis also shows that liquidity in 2023 is consistent with the historical relationship between liquidity and volatility. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for continued vigilance and efforts to enhance the market's resilience."

The strength of consumption can be attributed to factors such as the fast rollout of vaccines, larger-than-expected fiscal stimulus, and low interest rates. While there is uncertainty about the level of excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, a broader assessment of households' financial positions is more important than excess savings alone. The role of debt in supporting consumption is examined, with households benefiting from lower mortgage payments and cash-out refinances. Other forms of debt, such as student loans and credit cards, have also contributed to available funds for consumption. Indicators of households' financial health, such as delinquency rates and consumer expectations, suggest that the household sector is in a strong position. However, the end of very low interest rates and the resumption of student loan payments may tighten household finances in the future."

        "summary": "The end of the federal student loan payment pause has led to an analysis of borrower expectations regarding the impact of the payment resumption on future spending growth, credit delinquency, and the economy. The findings suggest that the resumption of payments will have a relatively small overall effect on consumption, with a 0.1 percentage point reduction in aggregate spending from August levels. Student loan delinquency rates are expected to return to pre-pandemic levels. Low-income borrowers, female borrowers, those with less than a bachelor's degree, and those who were not in repayment before the pandemic are more likely to expect missed student loan payments. The survey also revealed that enrollment in income-driven repayment (IDR) plans is expected to increase, particularly among low-income borrowers. Borrowers anticipate a decrease in average monthly spending of around $56 per month when payments resume. The likelihood of missing a student loan payment is higher for female borrowers and those with lower household incomes. However, expectations for missing non-student loan payments are more similar across groups. Overall, the impact of the payment resumption on consumption and delinquency is expected to be relatively modest, partly due to borrowers already adjusting their savings and consumption decisions in anticipation of the resumption."

        "summary": "China is unlikely to achieve its goal of reaching the per capita income of a mid-level developed country by 2035, according to economists Hunter L. Clark and Matthew Higgins. They argue that China's rapid growth is facing challenges such as population aging, diminishing returns to its investment-centered growth model, increased state management of the economy, credit issues in real estate, and limited access to foreign technologies. Even with generous assumptions about future growth, China is projected to close only a fraction of the income gap with high-income countries. The authors also highlight the constraints on China's future growth, including declining labor inputs due to population aging and diminishing returns to capital accumulation. They argue that achieving the necessary productivity growth to meet income goals is unlikely, given that China's productivity growth is already high and historical precedents show that very few countries have achieved such growth rates. Additionally, the authors point out the structural headwinds, such as state management of the economy, institutional development, the need to rebalance the economy, and high levels of private and government debt. The authors conclude that while China has strengths, such as a well-educated population and technological advancements, the odds of achieving the income growth target are stiff."

                            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Anthony Albanese, the leader of the Australian Labor Party, is criticized for his response to a question about renewable energy in Parliament. Instead of expressing willingness to work with the Parliament, Albanese attacked the Greens for pressuring him to strengthen the Housing Fund. This response is seen as evidence that Albanese will not change his approach.</p>

                            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The author of the article responds to a dispute with Matt Yglesias regarding the polarization of American politics. The author argues that the Republican Party has become an extreme-right party, comparable to Fidesz in Hungary, while the Democratic Party is a moderate party of the center and center-left. The author criticizes an article by Yglesias titled "Polarization is a choice," stating that it promotes a false equivalence between the two parties. The author believes that the polarization is primarily driven by the far-right radicalization of the Republican Party, influenced by right-wing media and extremist voters. The author concludes that the analysis of the US political scene as a contest between two normal parties is fundamentally wrong and that the intention to establish a permanent right-wing dictatorship is evident.</p>

                            <h1>Why Are China’s Households in the Doldrums?</h1>
                            <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/?p=24748" class="link" target="_blank">https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/?p=24748</a></p>
                            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> China's household balance sheets have been damaged by a prolonged borrowing binge, COVID-19 impacts, and a slump in the property market. As a result, consumer sentiment and confidence in future income gains are at record lows. The collapse of the property market has also led to a decline in residential investment spending and a decrease in property sales. Chinese households have responded by paying down their mortgage debt and increasing their savings deposits, indicating a shift towards risk aversion. However, these actions have contributed to a decline in consumer borrowing and slowed consumer credit growth. The Chinese government's efforts to revive demand for new homes have been unsuccessful, and policymakers face the challenge of reversing households' pessimistic attitudes to boost consumption and economic growth.</p>

                            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A study conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has found that "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services are being used by a wide range of consumers, but there are concerns about the potential risks associated with these payment plans. The study found that while BNPL can expand financial inclusion, especially for those with low credit scores, it also disproportionately attracts consumers with unmet credit needs and limited credit access. These users are more financially fragile and have a higher likelihood of accumulating excessive debt. The study also highlighted that BNPL loans may not benefit unbanked consumers or those who are "credit invisible." Additionally, there are concerns that BNPL may enable consumers to spend more than they otherwise would, leading to overextension and financial stress. The study calls for more data and analysis to fully understand the risks and benefits of BNPL and its impact on consumers' financial well-being.</p>

                            <h1>The New York Fed DSGE Model Forecast— September 2023</h1>
                            <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/?p=24812" class="link" target="_blank">https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/?p=24812</a></p>
                            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has updated its economic forecasts using its dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. The model predicts that the economy will remain resilient despite the tightening of monetary policy. Output growth is projected to be higher than previously forecasted, with a lower probability of a recession. Inflation projections remain close to previous forecasts, and the model expects inflation to return to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) goal by the end of next year. The forecast also shows that the output gap will be higher than previously estimated, indicating that the strength of the economy is driven by demand factors rather than supply factors. The real natural rate of interest is expected to decline over the forecast horizon. The article includes tables and charts that provide a visual representation of the forecasts. It is important to note that the DSGE model forecast is not an official forecast of the New York Fed, but rather an input to the Research staff's overall forecasting process.</p>

                            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The author reflects on George Polya's book "How to Solve It" and suggests an amendment to Polya's second rule of style. Instead of saying both things at the same time, the author proposes saying the first thing and then stopping. Another colleague suggests a more cynical amendment, stating that if you have two things to say, it's better to say nothing because nobody wants to hear it.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Anthony Albanese, the leader of the Australian Labor Party, is criticized for his response to a question about renewable energy in Parliament. Instead of expressing willingness to work with the Parliament, Albanese attacked the Greens for pressuring him to strengthen the Housing Fund. This response is seen as evidence that Albanese will not change his approach.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The author of the article responds to a dispute with Matt Yglesias regarding the polarization of American politics. The author argues that the Republican Party has become an extreme-right party, comparable to Fidesz in Hungary, while the Democratic Party remains a moderate party of the center and center-left. The author criticizes an article by Yglesias titled "Polarization is a choice," stating that it promotes a false equivalence between the two parties. The author asserts that the polarization in American politics is primarily driven by the radicalization of the Republican Party, fueled by interactions between Republican voters and right-wing media. The author concludes that the analysis of the US political scene as a contest between two normal political parties is fundamentally flawed, and that the intention to establish a permanent right-wing dictatorship is evident in certain projects.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> China's household balance sheets have been damaged by a prolonged borrowing binge, COVID-19 impacts, and a slump in the property market. As a result, consumer sentiment and confidence in future income gains are at record lows. The collapse of the property market has also led to a decline in residential investment spending and a decrease in property sales. Chinese households have responded by paying down their mortgage debt and increasing their savings deposits, indicating a shift towards risk aversion. However, these actions have contributed to a decline in consumer borrowing and slowed consumer credit growth. The Chinese government's efforts to revive demand for new homes have been unsuccessful, and policymakers face the challenge of reversing households' pessimistic attitudes to boost consumption and economic growth.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A study conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has found that "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services are being used by a wide range of consumers, but there are concerns about the potential risks associated with these payment plans. The study found that while BNPL can expand financial inclusion, especially for those with low credit scores, it also disproportionately attracts consumers with unmet credit needs and limited credit access. These users are more financially fragile and have a higher likelihood of accumulating excessive debt. The study also highlighted that BNPL loans may not benefit unbanked consumers or those who are "credit invisible." Additionally, there are concerns that BNPL may enable consumers to spend more than they otherwise would, leading to overextension and financial stress. The study calls for more data and analysis to fully understand the risks and benefits of BNPL and its impact on consumers' financial well-being.</p>

                        <h1>The New York Fed DSGE Model Forecast— September 2023</h1>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has updated its economic forecasts using its dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. The model predicts that the economy will remain resilient despite the tightening of monetary policy. Output growth is projected to be higher than previously forecasted, with a lower probability of a recession. Inflation projections remain close to previous forecasts, and the model expects inflation to return to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) goal by the end of next year. The forecast also shows that the output gap will be higher than previously estimated, indicating that the strength of the economy is driven by demand factors rather than supply factors. The real natural rate of interest is expected to decline over the forecast horizon. The article includes tables and charts that provide a visual representation of the forecasts. It is important to note that the DSGE model forecast is not an official forecast of the New York Fed, but rather an input to the Research staff's overall forecasting process.</p>

Another colleague suggests a more cynical amendment, stating that if you have two things to say, it's better to say nothing because nobody wants to hear it.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> French micro, small, and mid-cap companies are the focus of a series of articles. Visiativ, a French company, has announced a new strategic plan to achieve €500 million in sales by 2028, with 50% coming from international markets. The company's H1 2023 results showed increased expenses due to brand unification efforts. Sales teams' incentives have been changed to align with the transition to a SAAS model. Visiativ has implemented an employee shareholding plan, bringing their stake up to 6.37%. The company is pursuing external growth through resellers/integrators of Dassault Systèmes solutions, consulting, and software editing. Visiativ uses factoring to finance working capital and neutralize seasonality. They immobilize some R&D to demonstrate innovation. While Visiativ currently relies on Dassault Systèmes products for 50% of their sales, they aim to decrease this percentage over time. The author expresses hesitation in investing in Visiativ due to their dependency on an outside product. The company has started paying dividends since 2021, potentially due to financial leverage from the Alliativ holding.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Elise Loehnen, a writer with 80,000 Instagram followers, shares her insights on monetizing her audience and growing her Substack newsletter in an interview with Substack. Loehnen turned on paid subscriptions from the start and saw her Instagram followers become some of her first and highest-paying subscribers. She emphasizes the importance of writing compelling content and letting it speak for itself, rather than using clickbait or sales tactics. Loehnen also paywalls her evergreen content and regularly promotes older posts to drive paid subscriptions. She discusses her content strategy, which includes short essays, Q&As with experts, and additional content like word etymology videos and podcast episode pages. Loehnen aims to build her Substack enough to reduce her reliance on Instagram and hopes to eventually hire a full-time editor. She advises other writers to turn on paid subscriptions and focus on creating valuable content that people will forward to their friends.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the recent rise in global interest rates and its impact on government bonds. Long-term government bond yields in Europe and America have reached levels not seen in over a decade, increasing the cost of financing government expenses. The article also mentions the widening spread between Italian and German bonds and the normalization of yield curves. It highlights the possibility of interest rates reaching 7% and the opening of a large position betting on Fed Funds rates exceeding 6%. The article notes the difficult month of September for global stocks, with negative returns due to rising interest rates, potential government shutdowns, worker strikes, and economic difficulties in Europe. It also mentions the changing dynamics within the Republican Party and the lack of surprises in the second debate among Republican candidates for the presidential nomination. The article concludes by discussing the rise in oil prices and the potential for a Trump vs. Biden rematch in the next election.</p>

                        <h1>The Trouble With Charles Schwab</h1>
                        <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.thelastbearstanding.com/p/the-trouble-with-charles-schwab" class="link" target="_blank">https://www.thelastbearstanding.com/p/the-trouble-with-charles-schwab</a></p>
                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Charles Schwab's financial position has weakened, with a 44% decline in bank deposits over the past five quarters and substantial unrealized losses on its security portfolio. Its Tangible Common Equity capital is at just 1.8% of total assets, and it likely has negative tangible equity value. The company's future depends on customer decisions, monetary policy, regulatory action, and how it navigates these challenges. Charles Schwab Bank, the company's primary bank, has seen a significant decline in deposits due to rising interest rates. The company has drawn down its cash balance, reduced its securities portfolio, increased short-term borrowings, and brokered high-cost Certificates of Deposit to manage the cash outflow. While the company has access to substantial liquidity, any further borrowing or brokered deposits would be dilutive to net interest margins and capital balances. The decline in deposits has also impaired the value of the company's assets, resulting in unrealized losses and a decline in equity capital. The company's equity measures have deteriorated, but its Common Equity Tier 1 regulatory capital remains relatively constant due to the exclusion of unrealized losses. However, new regulations may change this treatment. If the regulatory change is implemented, it will be a headwind to Schwab's earnings and balance-sheet flexibility. The company may have negative tangible equity capital on a fair-market-value basis, but its reported regulatory capital ratios and Tangible Common Equity will remain positive.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Federal Reserve's long-run estimate of 2.5% for interest rates has remained unchanged since 2020, despite aggressive rate hikes in the short-term. This static estimate may be driven by factors such as credibility concerns and a preference for tackling inflation at the front end of the yield curve. The Fed's policy of raising short-term rates while maintaining a static long-run estimate softens the impact of rate hikes and allows borrowers to lock in debt at advantageous long-term fixed rates. However, the Fed has been forced to push up its dot plot for the next several years, leading to higher long-term interest rates. The recent FOMC meeting saw the Fed removing two rate cuts from its projections for 2024, effectively raising its rate guidance for 2024 and 2025. This adjustment in guidance has put incremental pressure on the long-end of the yield curve, with the entire U.S. Treasury yield curve currently sitting at cycle highs. The rationale for this increase may be stronger GDP growth projections or a gradual shift in the Fed's opinion on the neutral rate in a post-COVID economy.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The upcoming executive order on AI from the White House may require cloud computing platforms to share customer information with regulators, according to a report by Semafor. This approach, similar to a "know your customer" scheme, aims to prevent bad actors and foreign adversaries from accessing AI computing power. The regulation would be applied to well-established cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle, and IBM, which already have experience in regulatory compliance due to their work with financial institutions. Requiring cloud platforms to share customer information with regulators could also benefit AI startups by relieving them of the compliance burden. However, there are potential drawbacks to this approach, such as the difficulty of drawing a compute threshold and the possibility of regulatory capture, where incumbents benefit from increased regulation. Overall, the author believes that some level of regulation is necessary for AI, and requiring transparency from cloud platforms and treating them like banks is a reasonable approach.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the current state of the American economy and the potential consequences of excessive borrowing. It highlights the challenges posed by a shrinking workforce and tax base, as well as the impending retirement wave of the baby-boom generation. The article also emphasizes the importance of fiscal responsibility and the potential negative effects of unsustainable borrowing. Additionally, the article mentions the recent weakness in agricultural stocks and suggests a slow, dollar-cost-averaging approach for investors. It provides a list of recommended investment opportunities, including farm machinery stocks, Japanese yen, gold miners, cyber security software stocks, and more. The article concludes with a spotlight on Devon Energy, a company that has experienced a significant decline in stock price due to a correction in oil prices and a bear market in natural gas. Despite the decline, the article suggests that the stock may present a buying opportunity due to its low price-to-earnings ratio.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the current conditions for buying houses and the negative outlook for the homebuilders market. It highlights the low buyer traffic and affordability levels, which are at their worst since the 1980s. The article also mentions the performance of the leading homebuilder ETF, which is down 8% this month but still up 26% for the year. The article then shifts focus to emerging market debt and the reluctance of U.S. investors to buy it. It points out that many developing nations have better fiscal and monetary policies than the U.S. and have amassed trillions of dollars in foreign currency reserves. The article concludes by discussing Neil Howe's book, "The Fourth Turning Is Here," which suggests that the U.S. is on the cusp of a radical political makeover. It introduces the No Labels movement as a potential solution to the current political divide and calls for a rational and viable alternative to the current system. The article also includes a guest article by Michael Lewitt, who discusses the negative consequences of the policy responses to major events over the past 20 years and the need for a crisis to force a change in the system.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the potential investment opportunity in the Japanese yen. The author believes that the yen is undervalued and presents a long-term investment opportunity. They mention that the Bank of Japan's yield curve control policy, which artificially suppresses interest rates, may be coming to an end, which could lead to a rally in the yen. However, despite this potential catalyst, the yen has not experienced a significant price surge. The article includes charts showing the exchange rate between the yen and the dollar over the past decade. The author acknowledges that there may be a drag or friction cost when holding yen positions due to the wide spread between US T-bill rates and short rates in Japan. Overall, the author remains optimistic about the yen as a long-term investment.</p>

The company had a lot of variable rate debt and borrowed aggressively to buy assets, which has now come back to bite them. The article discusses strategies to identify potential dividend cuts before they become obvious, such as avoiding chasing high yields and focusing on stocks with low payout ratios. The author also suggests analyzing the situation and earnings of high yield stocks, as well as considering any recent changes that may affect the company's ability to maintain its dividend. The article concludes by discussing how to deal with a dividend cut, including the option of selling immediately or waiting for a potential rebound. Ultimately, the author recommends diversifying the portfolio with stocks that have strong cash flow, solid moats, and good management to minimize the risk of dividend cuts.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the concept of beating the market in investing. The author argues that while beating the market may be important for professional investors, it is not as crucial for amateur investors. The author also explores the challenge of determining which market index to compare one's portfolio performance to. They explain that their portfolio consists of Canadian stocks with a small number of US equities, making it difficult to find a suitable benchmark. The author emphasizes that their financial goals have shifted from chasing total returns to focusing on cash flow and dividends. They believe that even if they underperform the market slightly, they can still achieve wealth and financial security. The article concludes by stating that the purpose of investing is to become wealthy, not necessarily to beat an index, and that active investing should be about reaching one's financial goals rather than outperforming a benchmark.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Law of One Price, Discounted Cash Flow analysis, and Covered Interest Rate Parity are concepts that ensure pricing consistency in financial markets. However, these concepts are showing evidence of breaking down due to increasing regulatory rigidity and reliance on systematic portfolio construction approaches. The death of the 60/40 equity/bond portfolio is also being questioned, as few investors actually hold portfolios that adhere to this allocation. The trend towards passive investment and systematic portfolio rebalancing is contributing to market inefficiency, as fixed weight rebalancing strategies lack a self-correcting mechanism. While it is uncertain when a correction in mispricing will occur, it is likely to be qualitative rather than quantitative. The current bond/equity mispricing resembles the persistent undervaluation of value stocks, and there is a fear that it may persist longer than anticipated.</p>

The event will benefit Coney Island Prep, a public charter school in New York City. The article discusses the historical trend of declining real interest rates and argues that recent increases in interest rates are temporary and driven by central bank policies rather than inflationary pressures. It highlights the growing risk of refinancing, particularly in the high-yield sector, and warns of potential financial vulnerability if interest rates remain high. The author also discusses the long-term trend of lower real interest rates and attributes it to factors such as population pressures and surplus resources. The article concludes by noting that the current rise in interest rates is due to central bank actions and emphasizes the unprecedented speed and magnitude of this interest rate hiking cycle.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> China's household balance sheets have been damaged by a prolonged borrowing binge, COVID-19 impacts, and a slump in the property market. As a result, consumer sentiment and confidence in future income gains are at record lows. The collapse of the property market has also led to a decline in residential investment spending and a decrease in property sales. Chinese households have responded by paying down their mortgage debt and increasing their savings deposits, indicating a shift towards risk aversion. However, these actions have contributed to a decline in consumer borrowing and slowed consumer credit growth. The Chinese government's efforts to revive demand for new homes have been unsuccessful, and policymakers face the challenge of reversing households' pessimistic attitudes to boost consumption and economic growth.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A study conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has found that "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services are being used by a wide range of consumers, but there are concerns about the potential risks associated with these payment plans. The study found that while BNPL can expand financial inclusion, especially for those with low credit scores, it also disproportionately attracts consumers with unmet credit needs and greater financial fragility. The research revealed that BNPL users are more financially fragile and less likely to rely on savings in case of an emergency. Additionally, there is evidence that BNPL may enable consumers to spend and borrow more than they otherwise would. The study highlights the need for more data and analysis to assess the extent to which BNPL borrowing contributes to financial stress and overall financial well-being. The findings suggest that while BNPL services have benefits, there are risks associated with excessive debt accumulation and over-extension.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has updated its economic forecasts using its dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. The model predicts that the economy will remain resilient despite the tightening of monetary policy. Output growth is projected to be higher than previously forecasted, with a lower probability of a recession. Inflation projections remain close to previous forecasts, and the model expects inflation to return to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) goal by the end of next year. The forecast also shows that the output gap will be higher than previously estimated, indicating that the strength of the economy is driven by demand factors rather than supply factors. The real natural rate of interest is expected to decline over the forecast horizon. The article includes tables and charts that provide a visual representation of the forecasts. It is important to note that the DSGE model forecast is not an official forecast of the New York Fed, but rather an input to the Research staff's overall forecasting process.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Zebra Technologies, a high-quality industrial company, is currently experiencing a downturn due to disappointing Q2 numbers and reduced full-year guidance. The decline is attributed to the normalization of pandemic-level demand, particularly in the retail and logistics sectors. Additionally, Zebra faced a significant litigation settlement payment to competitor Honeywell, impacting its net income. However, despite these challenges, Zebra's growth potential is not reflected in its current valuation. With America's manufacturing construction activity at historically high levels, driven by onshoring and government stimulus, it is expected that spending will eventually lead to supply chain investments and new equipment purchases. Furthermore, Zebra's strategic shift from a hardware-centric company to a solutions provider offers ample growth opportunities, particularly in labor optimization solutions. The company has a capable management team with a track record of driving growth organically and through acquisitions. Overall, patient investors may find Zebra Technologies to be an attractive opportunity, considering its business, management, growth prospects, challenges, potential disruptions, and valuation.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the idea that nobody truly knows how others raise their children. The author points out that our understanding of parenting is limited by various factors, such as our own childhood memories being filtered through a child's perspective and the modification of memories over time. Observing parents in public spaces also presents a distorted view due to the observer effect and the lack of context. The author emphasizes that even experts in the field of parenting do not have a representative view, as their observations are based on a biased sample. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of recognizing the limitations of our knowledge about parenting.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the ongoing campaign for the "Voice" referendum in Australia, which has become a divisive issue. The referendum, set for October 14th, requires a majority of Australian voters in a majority of states to pass. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has tied his fate to the outcome, with a win bolstering his status within the party and a loss potentially leading to his slide into illegitimacy. The author argues that Albanese made a mistake by holding the referendum separately from elections, as legislating for "The Voice" during Labor's "honeymoon" period would have attracted less controversy. The campaign has driven a wedge between Australians and created an environment of anger, hate, and abuse. The author also raises concerns about the potential consequences of enshrining race into the constitution, citing Malaysia as an example where such policies led to a neo-feudal society and institutionalized corruption. The article concludes by suggesting that there could be a better way to address the issues faced by indigenous Australians.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is currently serving a jail sentence, may be granted a pardon in the future. There is speculation that the pardon could be granted sooner rather than later, in order to allow voters to forget about Najib's conviction before the next election. The power to grant a pardon lies with the Agong, the Malaysian monarch, who can act on it with or without the advice of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, has reportedly given his "green light" for the pardon. There are arguments in favor of a pardon for Najib, including the belief that he was not given the benefit of the doubt during his trial and that there may have been a miscarriage of justice. However, there are also those who oppose a pardon for Najib, including the media and the Bar Council, who have engaged in a "Trial by Media" against him. The decision to grant a pardon ultimately rests with the Agong, and there is no legal recourse against his decision.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Teacher absenteeism in government schools in Malaysia is a significant issue that negatively impacts students. A recent court case in Kota Kinabalu highlighted the problem, with a teacher being absent from class for seven months. The extent of the issue is difficult to measure due to deliberate cover-ups, falsification of records, and a culture of fear that prevents students from reporting absenteeism. Teacher absenteeism affects students' ability to progress in their education and perform well in exams, keeping them trapped in low-income social strata. It also hinders their ability to learn English, which is a compulsory subject for university admission. Teacher absenteeism can lead to mental health issues, loss of trust in adults, and a loss of hope for the future. It also degrades the quality of the workforce in the coming generation. The problem is a symptom of dissatisfaction within the teaching profession, with low motivation levels and some teachers engaging in other income-earning activities during school hours. The issue needs to be addressed before any other education reforms can be effective.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Defamation laws in Malaysia are being weaponized by lawyers to silence critics and prevent open public discussion. Lawyers are using these laws to intimidate writers, journalists, activists, and news portals critical of their clients. Some lawyers are even acting as proxies to cover up corruption by politicians. In addition to using defamation laws, lawyers are also attempting to extort cash payments from those accused of defaming their clients. They are making frivolous claims against legitimate criticisms and using defamation as a means to censor people. The article provides a list of lawyers who are questionable in their ethics and moral compass when it comes to using defamation laws. The author encourages readers to add names of lawyers who are abusing these laws in the comments. The article concludes by stating that lawyers have become the biggest obstacle to uncovering corruption in Malaysia.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Kledong Saiong Forest Reserve in Perak, Malaysia is facing environmental destruction as the state government awards logging and plantation concessions to corporations. Sahabat Alam Malaysia (SAM), an NGO, is actively opposing the plan to log and replace the natural forest with fast-growing plantation crops. The area is home to endangered species such as the Helmeted Hornbill and the Asian Brown Tortoise. The proposed logging site is located near an Orang Asli Kampong, and disturbing the natural habitat could lead to dangerous human-wildlife contact. Four companies have been given land within the forest reserve, all sharing the same registered address and appearing to be owned by the same group of shareholders. The Perak State government has not considered the interests of the Orang Asli living in the forest reserve. This case adds to the reputation of the Perak State government as an environmental vandal, as they have also allowed the destruction of the Dhamma Sakyamuni Caves Monastery.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Kuantan City Council in Malaysia has decided to rename Jalan Wong Ah Jang 1 to 5 to Jalan Bunga Kamboja 1 to 5, which is seen as part of a trend of eliminating Malaysia's heritage and sense of history. Wong Ah Jang, who arrived in Kuantan at the age of 15, played a significant role in the town's community development in the 1920s. This renaming is not an isolated incident, as several roads in Malaysia have had their names changed in the past, erasing the historical connections and heritage of the cities. The article argues that these name changes have taken away from the public's view of the history and the people involved in the formation and development of these cities. The younger generation is now without visual links to Malaysia's colonial past, which played a crucial role in building the nation.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Research Division of the Prime Minister's Department in Malaysia, also known as the Malaysian External Intelligence Organization (MEIO), is reportedly conducting joint operations with the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the South China Sea. The aim of these missions is to assist in maintaining Malaysian sovereignty in disputed sea areas and support US operations to enforce the "rules-based order" in the region. The project involves monitoring warships and fishing vessels, as well as leveraging support from parties like Petronas and the Sarawak Coast Guard to track the movements of Chinese and Vietnamese vessels. In addition, hydrological data, mineral, and seismic maps are being developed in disputed areas. The operations come at a time when Malaysia is facing increased Chinese incursions into disputed territories and rising tension between China and the United States. Malaysia is deploying more than naval forces for surveillance, including a Diamond Aircraft 42-MPP modified for surveillance. The joint operations with the US are seen as a way to protect Malaysian sovereignty and are part of the US's containment strategy against Chinese activities in the South China Sea. The program has also created leverage for Malaysia in its communications with China over the South China Sea.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses three questions related to the energy industry. The first question addresses whether peak oil supply fears will return. The author argues that there is no peak to oil demand in the foreseeable future and that all forms of energy will be needed to meet the growing demand. The second question examines the outperformance of traditional energy stocks compared to new energy stocks and what it says about opportunities in the industry. The author suggests that the market is demanding evidence of profitable scaling in new energy business models. The third question explores whether new energies have a future. The author emphasizes that struggles in one area of new energy, such as offshore wind, do not indicate that the entire sector is doomed. They believe that both new and old forms of energy will be necessary to meet long-term energy needs. Overall, the article highlights the importance of considering different perspectives and opportunities in the energy industry.</p>

                        <h1>Less Tax Evasion, a Profit Boom, and a Persistent Interest Puzzle: Highlights of the 2023 Comprehensive NIPA Revisions (Part 1)</h1>
                        <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://theovershoot.co/p/less-tax-evasion-a-profit-boom-and" class="link" target="_blank">https://theovershoot.co/p/less-tax-evasion-a-profit-boom-and</a></p>
                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The U.S. national accounts measure economic activity through two aggregates: GDP (expenditure-based estimate) and GDI (income-based estimate). However, there is often a "statistical discrepancy" between the two, leading to contradictory answers about the state of the economy. Since 2021, there have been large swings in the discrepancy between GDP and GDI. The gap was initially due to GDP understating business investment and GDI overstating workers' wages. More recently, GDI has been falling sharply compared to GDP because of a 31% drop in American businesses' net interest payments. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) publishes comprehensive revisions every five years, which have resulted in both measures of economic output being revised up by nearly 2% as of 2023Q2. However, the gap between the income-based and expenditure-based estimates remains large. The revisions have been influenced by changes in the treatment of regulated investment companies, growth in corporate profits during the pandemic, new estimates of tax evasion, revisions in spending on imputed rent, and changes in investment spending. The discrepancy in net interest payments by businesses also persists.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Aramark is set to spin off its uniform rental and workplace supplies division, Vestis Corp, at the end of September. Vestis provides uniform rentals and workplace supplies to businesses, with total sales of $2.7 billion in 2022. The uniform rental market is estimated to be worth $10.3 billion, with Cintas as the clear leader. Vestis is targeting 5-7% sales growth and 18-20% EBITDA margins by 2028. The spin-off is expected to have a loaded 4x levered balance sheet and a discount to peers due to high leverage. The estimated equity value of Vestis is $7-8.50 per share. Aramark's remaining business, focused on food and facilities management, operates in a $540 billion market. The balance sheet is 4.7x levered, and the business is seen as a levered COVID recovery play. The estimated value of Aramark's remaining business is $25-30 per share, with potential additional value from seasonal cash generation and asset sales. Both Vestis and Aramark's remaining business will start with around 4x leverage and plan to reduce it over the next few years.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The world is experiencing exponential growth in the adoption of clean-energy technologies, particularly solar, batteries, and electric vehicles (EVs). Solar output has nearly doubled since 2019, with some countries generating over 10% of their electricity from solar. EV sales have increased from 2.2 million in 2019 to an estimated 14 million this year, and EVs could make up 1 in 5 new vehicles sold worldwide. The growth of these technologies has led to a surge in battery manufacturing, with the US and EU seeing significant increases in production. However, China remains the dominant player in solar manufacturing, accounting for a large share of global production. The US and EU are trying to catch up but still rely heavily on imports, particularly from China. Geopolitical competition for control over these industries is intensifying, leading to green trade wars and efforts to onshore manufacturing. The article highlights the importance of international cooperation and coordination to avoid underbuilding green energy technologies and to ensure a smooth transition to a clean energy future.</p>

First, it highlights the improvement in working-class wealth in the US, with the bottom 50% of households experiencing strong wealth growth in real terms since 2012. Second, it explores the increasing health inequality in America, particularly among those without college degrees, as evidenced by declining life expectancies. Third, it examines the rise of zero-sum thinking in the US, as shown by a survey that indicates younger Americans have a higher index of zero-sum thinking compared to older generations. Fourth, it emphasizes the challenges of obtaining accurate economic data, citing examples of historical GDP per capita estimates and discrepancies in energy price indices. Finally, it addresses the distinction between indigenous knowledge and science, asserting that while indigenous knowledge is valuable, it is not equivalent to science in terms of transferability and testability.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> President Biden recently made history by joining striking UAW workers near Detroit, solidifying his image as a champion of the working class. This comes as part of a larger labor revival in the US, with major strikes happening across various industries. The labor revival has the support of the Biden Administration and the American people, as unions are more popular than they have been in decades. However, the UAW strike may face challenges due to the ongoing shift from internal combustion cars to electric vehicles in the auto industry. This shift will reduce the importance of traditional heavily unionized industry clusters like Detroit and transform the nature of auto manufacturing. The ability of US institutions, including car companies, the government, and labor, to adapt to these changes will determine whether union-friendly states can avoid a new version of the Rust Belt. Electric vehicles are expected to dominate the marketplace in the next couple of decades.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the shortcomings of America's socialist movement and Bernie Sanders' campaign. The author criticizes the socialists for their obsession with power and factionalism, which led them to focus on attacking Democrats and progressives who weren't part of their faction. The author argues that Bernie and his supporters missed the opportunity to create a real grassroots movement and instead bungled it. However, the problems that fueled the socialist movement, such as expensive healthcare, inequality, high student debt, and climate change, still exist. The author proposes more realistic versions of four of Bernie's ideas: Medicare for All, a wealth tax, student debt cancellation, and the Green New Deal. For universal healthcare, the author suggests using a system like Japan's, which would address the high costs of American healthcare. The author also argues that the focus should be on reducing hidden healthcare costs rather than eliminating out-of-pocket costs. Overall, the author believes that while the socialist movement had its flaws, some of their ideas can be refined and implemented effectively to address the country's major issues.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Xi Jinping, the leader of China, is facing criticism for his handling of various issues, including the country's economic slowdown, diplomatic blunders, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Critics argue that Xi's personal objections to certain economic policies and his ideological preference for austerity have hindered efforts to stimulate China's economy. Additionally, Xi's growing paranoia and series of purges of his own officials have caused turmoil within China's leadership. Internationally, Xi's aggressive and bellicose approach has alienated neighboring countries and led to a negative perception of China. Furthermore, China's "zero COVID" policy and reliance on domestically produced vaccines have been met with challenges and have contributed to economic difficulties. Overall, there are concerns about Xi's competence as a leader and the impact of his decisions on China's future. However, given his consolidation of power and the lack of alternatives, it is unlikely that Xi will step down voluntarily.</p>

                        <h1>Why do economists get paid more than sociologists?</h1>
                        <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-do-economists-get-paid-more-than" class="link" target="_blank">https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-do-economists-get-paid-more-than</a></p>
                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Economists tend to make higher salaries than sociologists, and there are various reasons for this disparity. One explanation is the difference in supply and demand. Economists have fewer people interested in becoming economists compared to sociologists, which means that universities have to pay economists more to attract them. Additionally, economists have more outside options, such as working in the private sector as consultants or data scientists, which increases their bargaining power and allows them to command higher salaries. Another factor is the higher demand for economics classes from undergraduates, particularly business majors. Universities may be more desperate to hire economists to meet this demand, leading to higher salaries for economists. However, it is challenging to determine the true story behind the salary differential between economists and sociologists, as it requires empirical testing and matching theoretical models to data. Nonetheless, understanding market forces and social factors can shed light on the reasons behind the salary gap.</p>

The author highlights the different measures of quality used by various ETF and index providers, such as return on equity and leverage. They also mention that purely quantitative methods may overlook the ease with which a CFO can manipulate a company's earnings. The article explores how Harding Loevner ranks quality using profitability and balance sheet strength measures. It also examines the persistence of quality factors over time and the distribution of quality stocks across sectors. The author concludes that determining a company's quality and its ability to persist is challenging.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> At a recent Quality Growth conference in London, fund managers discussed their investment criteria. The common themes among the managers were a focus on competitive advantage, growth, and the importance of a capable management team. Surprisingly, the frequency of citing returns as a factor was lower than expected. Valuation was mentioned by only half of the managers, with one presenter downplaying its significance. The article also highlights the difficulty of defining and assessing a sustainable competitive advantage. The author then shares a list of hot buttons for identifying quality and growth stocks, obtained from Chat GPT. The list includes factors such as earnings growth, revenue growth, competitive advantage, and valuation. The author acknowledges the challenge of executing a quality growth strategy and plans to explore the topic further in future articles. The article also discusses a presentation by Baillie Gifford, which emphasized the importance of staying the course with growth stocks and focusing on the long term. The presentation highlighted the gains and drawdowns of Baillie Gifford's top 10 winners and emphasized the need to let winners run.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Transmedics, a medical technology company, has developed the Organ Care System (OCS), a machine that preserves organs for transplantation. The OCS replicates the conditions of the body and perfuses oxygenated blood, creating a better environment for organ preservation. While there is no strong clinical evidence that OCS-preserved organs have better outcomes than those preserved using traditional cold storage, cardiologists tend to prefer OCS-preserved organs. The OCS also broadens the potential pool of organ recipients by allowing transportation of organs to distant locations. Transmedics focuses on liver and heart transplants, which are growing markets with a significant gap between supply and demand. The company operates on a pay-per-use model, offering the OCS to hospitals as part of its National OCS Program. Transmedics faces competition from cold storage methods and other warm perfusion systems, but it enjoys a first-mover advantage and limited competition. Risks to the company include execution and the challenge of building a logistical aviation network. Despite these risks, Transmedics has a strong market position and potential for growth, with a projected enterprise value of $5 billion by 2028.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Italian bonds have been outperforming other European bonds, but interest rates across Europe are expected to rise, which could impact Italian bonds. Italy's 30-year BTP yields have reached their highest level since January 2014. The current setup suggests that yields will increase across the curve and risk premiums will rise. The spread between Italian bonds and German Bunds is expected to form a cyclical trend. The article provides yield targets for Italy's 2-year and 10-year bonds, as well as the 5-30 yield curve and the BTP-Bund 10-year spread. The article also includes charts and analysis for each of these metrics. The technical setup indicates that the trend change will be durable, but the driving factors behind the trend change are still uncertain. Overall, the article suggests that the trend in Italian bonds is likely to change in the coming months.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Chinese consumer sentiment remains weak and cautious, with borrowing patterns indicating mortgage repayment and lower demand for long-term loans. There has been an increase in secondary market real estate interest in some parts of big cities, but smaller cities show a different trend. The decline in secondary market housing prices has a significant impact on consumer spending and savings patterns. Deposit increases typically precede a rise in short-term loan demand. The Catering and Hotel Index has held support, suggesting a potential bounce and future impact on consumer sentiment. Overall, the outlook for Chinese consumer spending is mixed, with signs of recovery but also caution among consumers.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The author discusses two investment experiences: one with a small company called Four Corners, Inc. and another with Wilh. Wilhelmsen Holding ASA. In the case of Four Corners, the author had invested in the company and was pleased with its performance until it agreed to a transaction that would sell its assets at a discount, benefiting insiders. This highlights the importance of management in small companies and the misalignment of interests between insiders and outside investors. On the other hand, the author reflects on their investment in Wilh. Wilhelmsen Holding ASA, which traded at a significant discount to its asset value. Despite the lack of value-unlocking transactions, the company's underlying assets grew in value, resulting in a good return for shareholders. This emphasizes the importance of analyzing the growth potential of underlying assets rather than solely focusing on the discount to net asset value. The author also shares some interesting historical tidbits about Monarch Cement and reflects on the prevalence of prejudice in the early 20th century. The article concludes with a mention of the author's Q2 letter and their openness to discussing investment ideas.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Walt Disney's theme park, Disneyland, which opened in 1955, revolutionized the entertainment industry and led to the creation of other successful parks such as Walt Disney World, Tokyo Disney Resort, Disneyland Resort Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland. However, the Parks & Resorts business faced challenges after the September 11th attacks and experienced a decline in profitability. In 2003, then CEO Michael Eisner predicted a continued reduction in capital expenditures and an increase in free cash flow. This prediction came true, with average annual capital expenditures from 2004 to 2008 decreasing compared to previous years, while segment EBITDA less capital expenditures doubled. This resulted in increased free cash flow for Disney's Parks, Experiences, and Products segment.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The author discusses the importance of being a learning machine in investing and shares a quote from Warren Buffett: "Beware of geeks bearing formulas." The author highlights the tendency of some investors to rely too heavily on spreadsheet math and overlook the fundamental understanding of a business. They caution against investing solely based on spreadsheet projections and emphasize the need to consider qualitative factors and variant perceptions. The author also mentions the attraction of spreadsheet-friendly businesses like restaurants and retailers with room for expansion, but warns against building a portfolio solely based on these types of companies. They use Dollar General as an example of a once-popular compounder stock that has experienced a significant decline. The author concludes by encouraging investors to spend more time thinking about the underlying business and developing a differentiated view rather than relying solely on spreadsheet analysis.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Conor Maguire, Founder and Editor of the Value Situations Newsletter, discusses his thesis on Marlowe plc, a provider of compliance software and services. Marlowe is a roll-up business that has been acquiring companies in the testing, inspection, certification (TIC) and governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) sectors. Maguire believes that Marlowe is undervalued and presents a good investment opportunity. He highlights the company's strong financial performance, with revenues and EBITDA meeting targets and showing good organic growth. He also mentions the potential for a sale of the TIC business, which could unlock significant value for shareholders. Maguire addresses the bear case, which focuses on the company's adjusted earnings and lack of cash flow. He argues that the adjustments are necessary for integration costs and that the cash flow profile of the business is solid. He also discusses the management incentives and the potential for capital allocation decisions. Overall, Maguire sees Marlowe as a cheap and fundamentally sound investment opportunity.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Federal Reserve's rate hike campaign appears to be over, with the probability of further rate hikes diminishing quickly. Critics of direct air capture (DAC) technology raise valid concerns, but The Gregor Letter argues that we should invest in DAC regardless. The US government is making moves to support DAC, including announcing prize money and funding for demonstration projects. However, the missing element in current DAC discourse is the vision of how DAC would look in its optimal state, running on 100% clean energy. Driving an electric vehicle (EV) in any US state now creates less pollution than an internal combustion engine (ICE) car, according to Yale Climate Connections. This assessment is based on the fuel mix in each state's electricity grid. While this analysis only considers the pump-to-wheel accounting, which excludes upstream mining and CO2 emissions, EVs still outperform ICE vehicles in both pump-to-wheel and well-to-wheel accounting. The Gregor Letter has been presenting comprehensive well-to-wheel accountings for years, showing the superiority of EVs over ICE vehicles.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The world's energy system has seen minimal change in the past decade, with natural gas, hydro, and nuclear maintaining a stable global energy share. However, coal and oil have experienced significant declines in market share, with coal losing three percentage points and oil losing one and a half percentage points. Renewables, particularly wind and solar, have seen a significant increase in global energy share, gaining nearly six percentage points. The challenge in decarbonization lies in cleaning up transportation and industrial processes, which require more complex solutions than cleaning up power grids. The stagnation of global nuclear power over the past 20 years is seen as a missed opportunity to further reduce the market share of natural gas. The article emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to decarbonization that includes not only wind, solar, and batteries but also electrification of vehicles and the development of nuclear power.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Macau is experiencing a surge in tourism during the October Golden Week, with an average of 100,000 daily tourists expected. Despite its small size of 33.3 sq km, Macau is attracting a large number of visitors, easily surpassing its population of 680,000. The Global Tourism Economy Forum (GTEF) in Macau, attended by tourism ministers and leaders from various organizations, is being hailed as the "Davos of Tourism." Macau is investing in night-time attractions and non-gaming entertainment to appeal to a younger demographic. The hotel industry in Macau has seen a significant recovery, with high occupancy rates and increased room rates. The city is also focusing on diversifying its economy and attracting investment in sectors such as health and wellness, MICE, and cultural events. The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge is playing a crucial role in improving connectivity and boosting tourism in the Greater Bay Area. Macau's casino resorts are investing in residency shows and developing a year-round concert schedule to enhance its nightlife. The city is transforming into a destination with themed resorts, such as The Londoner, The Venetian, and The Parisian, offering a variety of entertainment options.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Retail sales in China remain weak, with the recovery seen in travel and services rather than consumable goods. The property market also remains subdued despite policy loosening. Monthly retail sales values have been between CNY 3.5 and 4.0 trillion, and it is uncertain whether CNY 4 trillion is a ceiling or if it will be surpassed later in the year.

They highlight three lessons learned from their experience: 1) Investing in stocks that are undervalued and have the potential for positive catalysts can lead to significant returns. 2) Luck plays a role in investing, but positioning oneself in asymmetric opportunities can increase the chances of benefiting from unexpected positive developments. 3) A dirt cheap valuation can act as its own catalyst, and management actions such as share buybacks can drive stock prices higher. The author believes that AMR still has upside potential but is considering trimming their holdings. They emphasize the importance of knowing when to exit a profitable investment and finding new opportunities to continue compounding capital.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The fall Covid-19 vaccine rollout in the US is facing numerous challenges. Nursing homes are still waiting for vaccines, people are being turned away at appointments, and some are being asked to pay for the vaccine. This is because the government is no longer responsible for purchasing or distributing Covid-19 vaccines, as they have now been commercialized. General Gus Perna, the Chief Operations Officer of Operation Warp Speed, is no longer in charge of the vaccine distribution. The article highlights the difficulty of promptly and equitably distributing vaccines to 330 million people during an emergency. It emphasizes the importance of public-private partnerships and the efforts of many individuals working behind the scenes to save lives. The author attended a summit where General Perna shared his experience and praised the power of public-private partnerships. The article concludes by urging readers to watch the recording of General Perna's speech to gain a new appreciation for the vaccine distribution effort.</p>

                        <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/dont-be-surprised-if-masks-come-back" class="link" target="_blank">https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/dont-be-surprised-if-masks-come-back</a></p>
                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> As winter approaches, the question of whether to reinstate mandatory masking in hospitals and long-term care facilities arises. The scientific evidence supports the case for reinstating masks in these settings. In-hospital respiratory infections, including those acquired during the fall and winter, have been a problem for decades. Community transmission increases the risk of hospital transmission. Healthcare workers often come to work sick due to high workload burden and a lack of paid sick time. Masks have been shown to be effective in reducing infections, especially in hospitals. However, there are arguments against mandatory masks, such as the negative impact on healthcare workers and the question of preventability of in-hospital respiratory infections. The decision on whether to reinstate masks ultimately depends on values. Possible options include keeping mandatory masking throughout the year, implementing universal masking during a specific window of time, or requiring masks in high-risk units. It is likely that hospitals and long-term care facilities will return to mandatory masking soon. Masks are a low-cost and minimally invasive intervention that can help protect high-risk individuals during the fall and winter season.</p>

It also highlights the strategic importance of Central Asia for both China and Russia, as it serves as a gateway to Europe and a crucial region for energy resources. The article concludes by stating that the US is likely to continue its efforts to strengthen ties with Central Asian countries, which could lead to increased competition and tensions between the US, China, and Russia in the region.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Thailand's recent general election saw a record 75 percent voter turnout, with the public demanding radical reform of governance. The Move Forward Party (MFP) gained popularity by pledging to review the monarch's privileges and revise or abolish the lèse-majesté law. However, the ruling elite outplayed the MFP by squeezing former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to concede in return for a royal pardon that reduced his prison sentence. This split the opposition and forced Thaksin and his party to ally with the military parties to form the new government. The Constitutional Court played a role in disqualifying MFP leader Pita Limjaroenrat, who had inherited shares in a defunct TV company, breaching election regulations. Thaksin's return was carefully orchestrated, with his pardon leading to the formation of a government that goes against the reform promises of the opposition party. The simmering resentment among voters could lead to protests, as they are aware of ruling class misdeeds and royal greed. The Constitutional Court, which has dissolved opposition parties and nullified elections in the past, is seen as unfit for its purpose. King Maha Vajiralongkorn's unconventional behavior and control over the Crown Property Bureau have also caused discontent among student protestors.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Vietnamese syndicates are heavily involved in the illegal trade of elephant ivory, rhinoceros horn, pangolin scales, and other wildlife products, according to an undercover investigation by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). The investigation reveals the intricate routes used to transport ivory and rhino horn from African ports to Malaysia, Laos, and finally Vietnam. The report highlights the role of Malaysian and Laotian transport hubs and the widespread corruption in these countries. The EIA report also provides detailed profiles of key syndicate members, including Phan Chi, who operates with impunity and has close relations with high-level officials in Africa and Vietnam. The report emphasizes the need for action by African, Asian, and American authorities to combat these syndicates and protect Africa's wildlife from extinction. The recent arrest and imprisonment of Teo Boon Ching, a key player in the syndicate, offers hope for dismantling these criminal networks.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The current crisis between Canada and India could have been avoided through careful diplomacy and compromise. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of being involved in the assassination of a Sikh separatist in Vancouver, which India has dismissed as absurd and politically motivated. Trudeau's accusation has caused a furor and raised concerns about the Khalistan movement, which seeks independence for the Indian state of Punjab. The Sikh diaspora in Canada is politically significant, and Trudeau's governing coalition relies on the support of the Sikh-led New Democratic Party. The dispute between Canada and India has the potential to give the Khalistan cause international credibility, despite there being no significant Sikh minority in Punjab seeking independence. The involvement of India in the alleged assassination remains unclear, and mediation efforts by President Biden and his officials are underway to resolve the impasse.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has defied his predecessor's policy and moved the country closer to a confrontation with China. The country's coast guard, under his orders, removed a 300-meter-long floating barrier at the disputed Scarborough Shoal. This move has raised concerns about escalating tensions between the Philippines and China in the South China Sea. The removal of the barrier has been criticized by some prominent Filipino opinion influencers who believe it undermines the country's sovereignty and territorial claims. The Scarborough Shoal has been a source of contention between the Philippines and China, with both countries asserting their ownership over the area. This latest action by President Marcos Jr. has further complicated the already tense situation in the region.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The latest edition of the China Standard Map, which reaffirms China's claims to the South China Sea, including parts of Malaysia, has raised concerns in the region. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has stated that he received assurances from Chinese Premier Li Qiang that China's claims do not infringe on Malaysia's sovereignty. However, these assurances have been met with skepticism, as China's actions in the South China Sea have been aggressive and assertive. The South China Sea is a highly contested area, with multiple countries, including China, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia, claiming sovereignty over various islands and waters. The tensions in the region have escalated in recent years, with China building military installations on artificial islands and conducting naval exercises. The international community, including the United States, has called for a peaceful resolution to the disputes and for the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea to be upheld.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is facing a deepening crisis in the country's agriculture sector, despite his efforts to address the food crisis. Marcos promised to support farmers and promote farming, but his actions have been criticized as inadequate "band-aid treatments." The main issue is the shrinking harvest area in the Philippines, which has led to increased imports of rice and other agricultural products. Marcos has been urged to recognize this problem and take decisive action. Critics also point out that Marcos lacks effective management skills and fails to consult with advisers on important decisions. They argue that his father, former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr., understood the importance of rice as a political commodity and ensured its supply. Suggestions have been made to establish a system that allows farmers to store their harvests in government warehouses and sell directly to consumers with logistical support. The article suggests that Marcos could learn from India's success in achieving food self-sufficiency and becoming a major rice exporter.</p>

This action suggests that the prime minister has given his approval. The defamation suits come after Hsien Yang made allegations against the government and his brother on social media. The legal action is seen as an attempt to silence critics and maintain the ruling party's control over the country.

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> India and Canada are engaged in a diplomatic spat after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of being involved in the death of Sikh Canadian leader Hardeep Nijjar. India has retaliated by expelling the Canadian intelligence chief in Delhi and suspending all visas to India. The tension between the two countries may take years to repair, and trust may not be fully restored. India believes that the Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) organization in Canada, which Nijjar was associated with, is backed by Pakistan and aims to undermine India's reputation. The suspension of visas is the latest measure taken by India to defend itself against the accusation of killing Nijjar. The Canadian government's allegations are seen by India as politically driven. The diplomatic dispute has also highlighted the lack of Canadian interest in bringing those responsible for the 1985 Air India bombing to justice. The spat may have unintended consequences for Trudeau, as it could strengthen the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India. India is counting on the undermining of Trudeau within the Western alliance.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Luxury brands focus on crafting an experience and curating an image rather than directly selling products. Advertising is used for storytelling and brand building, not for promoting sales. Luxury brands target a select audience and aim to deepen the relationship with true enthusiasts. They guide customers through their brand universe and educate them about their unique codes and language. Luxury brands maintain exclusivity by shielding core clients from outsiders and communicating messages that are heard by those who will never buy the product. While celebrities can bring attention, luxury brands avoid aligning too closely with them to maintain their intrinsic value. Engaging with the arts is a strategic alignment that speaks to those who appreciate both the arts and the brand. In terms of organizational strategy, luxury brands do not relocate their factories, avoid external consultants, resist group synergies, and prioritize adding value over cost-cutting. In the digital age, luxury brands balance the benefits of global reach with the need to maintain their unique brand essence. Very few companies rigorously adhere to all the principles of luxury, and the definition of luxury can vary. Authentic luxury is often about the journey, the wait, and the exclusivity of the acquisition.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the Bank of England have decided to keep interest rates unchanged. This led to a slight drop in gold and silver prices, but silver has shown more resilience. The low open interest on Comex suggests that the downside for silver is limited. However, the strong dollar and rising bond yields pose a challenge for precious metals. The charts for 10-year bund and JGB yields indicate that they are likely to rise significantly. The global economy is contracting, and borrowers are facing difficulties due to higher interest rates. Hedge funds have traditionally believed that high interest rates are negative for gold, but there is a transition towards fear of the economic and monetary outlook for fiat currencies. The dollar has been strong recently due to these fears, but history has shown that in times of crisis, there is often an initial flight to the safety of the dollar. However, higher interest rates could ultimately crash the dollar, making gold an attractive investment.</p>

The author argues that the average American citizen's trust in fiscal and monetary policy can be seen in the fact that Costco is selling gold bars, indicating a desire to transact U.S. dollars for real money. The author suggests that this reflects weariness with government spending and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. The article also highlights the concerns about inflation, corporate bailouts, and the overvaluation of the stock market. The author concludes by stating that the public's understanding and questioning of central banking policies are becoming more prevalent, which could have significant implications for the confidence that Americans place in the Federal Reserve.</p>

The author criticizes CNBC for not giving enough attention to economic iconoclasts and Austrian thinkers. They specifically mention an incident where CNBC's "Fast Money" invited Bill Fleckenstein, a well-known advocate for the Austrian school, to discuss the macroeconomy. Instead of welcoming his contrarian viewpoint, one of the hosts labeled him "pathetic" and criticized his stance on gold and silver miners. The author provides three exhibits to support their claim that CNBC tends to celebrate bullish views without being skeptical or holding anyone accountable for missed calls. The article concludes by inviting readers to watch the video of the exchange between Fleckenstein and the host.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A recent search on PubMed using the search terms "COVID-19 vaccines" revealed over 6,000 peer-reviewed studies on vaccine hesitancy and how governments can overcome it. These studies focus on identifying vaccine-hesitant groups, statistics on these populations, and strategies to overcome vaccine hesitancy through propaganda, censorship, the law, and behavioral control. The government, along with organizations like the WHO and UNICEF, has spent billions of dollars to manipulate beliefs and eliminate informed consent. The government-funded "We Can Do This" campaign used a mix of digital, television, print, radio, and out-of-home channels to increase vaccine confidence and uptake. The campaign utilized propaganda and repetitive messaging to influence people's decision to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The success of this campaign has shown that governments will likely increase their use of propaganda, censorship, and behavioral modification tools in future health crises. The public is becoming more skeptical and untrusting, which poses a challenge for the administrative state. However, the fight against these tactics will likely be bigger next time.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> University professors are grappling with the challenge of students using AI chatbots like ChatGPT to complete their assignments and essays. However, some professors, like Stephen Hicks from Rockford University, embrace this technology as a research tool that can enhance learning and skill development. The author argues that AI has the potential to disrupt critical thinking itself, which poses a new threat to a free society that relies on independent thinkers. On the one hand, AI may diminish critical thinking by becoming a crutch for students. On the other hand, it may also elevate critical thinking by providing new opportunities for analysis and understanding. The author suggests that in the future, human critical thinking may need to focus on questioning the biases of AI and its developers. Ultimately, the hope is that AI can be used as a tool for the betterment of society, promoting freedom and responsibility.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Chinese gold demand improved in August, with gold withdrawals from the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) totaling 161 tons, a 46-ton increase from the previous month. Despite a decline in the price of gold in dollar terms, it was up 1.8% in yuan due to Chinese currency weakness. Gold has outperformed most other assets in China, leading to strong wholesale and retail demand. Chinese investors are turning to gold as a safe-haven asset, with metal flowing into Chinese gold-backed ETFs for the third consecutive month. The People's Bank of China also added 29 tons of gold to its reserves in August, marking the 10th straight month of gold buying. However, high gold prices could pose challenges for the Chinese gold market. The World Gold Council predicts that an improved outlook for China's economy and upcoming jewelry fairs and industry events may support local gold demand.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The recently enacted Digital Services Act (DSA) in the European Union (EU) poses a significant threat to freedom of speech. Under the DSA, the European Commission has the power to restrict citizens' ability to engage in democratic discourse on digital platforms. The Act empowers the Commission to pressure platforms to curb "hate speech," "disinformation," and threats to "civic discourse," which are vague and subjective categories. The legislation gives the Commission discretionary powers to oversee content moderation policies, effectively holding freedom of speech hostage to the ideological preferences of unelected officials. The Act also creates "trusted flaggers" who can report illegal content, and platforms are required to prioritize their reports. Non-compliance with the Act can result in fines of up to 6% of a platform's annual global turnover. The Act also requires platforms to undertake risk mitigation assessments and periodic audits, giving the Commission the power to impose multi-billion dollar fines for non-compliance. The Act places enormous power and discretion in the hands of the unelected European Commission, jeopardizing free speech and allowing the Commission to advance its favored political narrative.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the importance of considering both the price and cost when making a purchase. It uses the example of buying a house to illustrate this concept. The price of the house is the amount listed, while the cost includes the price plus the cost of borrowing (interest). The article emphasizes that the cost is often more significant in the long run, as illustrated by the example of a mortgage where the buyers end up paying over $1 million in interest alone. The article also highlights the role of realtors in negotiating the price and the potential impact on their reputations. It concludes by mentioning the increase in interest rates set by the Bank of Canada and the potential impact on mortgage holders. Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of considering the total cost rather than just the price when making purchasing decisions.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the divide between different political camps in the developed West regarding climate change. On one extreme are the "hard right" or "climate deniers" who believe climate change is a hoax. On the other extreme are the "hard left" or "climate alarmists" who believe the world is in danger due to fossil fuels. In between these extremes are the "soft right" and "soft left" who have differing levels of concern for the climate crisis. The article highlights cracks appearing in the left-leaning alliance, with the UK Conservative Party leading a retreat from climate change targets. This retreat is driven by concerns about the cost and impact on standard of living. Similar retrenchments have been observed in Sweden and Canada, and there is a rightward tilt in German politics. The article suggests that the relentless assault on fossil fuels is causing economic hardship for lower and middle classes, and the crisis in the commodity markets for diesel and heating oil may further weaken the political power of climate alarmists.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> During World War II, Germany relied on synthetic fuels made from coal due to a lack of domestic oil supplies. However, the net energy produced from transforming coal into fuels was significantly lower than directly pumping and refining oil, giving the Allies a decisive advantage. The article criticizes the current trend of promoting "eFuels," which involve using CO2 as a primary feedstock to produce synthetic fuels. The aviation sector, in particular, is interested in eFuels as a way to reduce carbon emissions. However, the article argues that the process of making jet fuel from CO2 is impractical and questions the feasibility of using eFuels to achieve net-zero targets. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the limitations of energy conversion and the historical lessons from Germany's experience with synthetic fuels during the war.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Private equity firms, which were previously seen as a structural short due to lack of capital investment and high debt, have experienced a rebound in 2023. The author initially believed that rising interest rates, pressure on capital markets, and reduced exits would negatively impact these companies. However, they have since seen a resurgence.</p>

They argue that long-short hedge funds have performed poorly since 2008 because they typically do the opposite. The author also reflects on their past mistakes of going bearish in 2016 and 2019, emphasizing that the market is now more political than macro. They mention their top short position in TLT, which continues to attract capital despite its poor performance. The article concludes by mentioning that the strategy of being long S&P 500 futures and short individual stocks has been successful in 2023, and the author explores one short theme that has worked and its potential future prospects.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the concept of empires and their influence on geopolitics. It compares the dominance of the British Empire in the past to the current dominance of the US military. The author suggests that the decline of the US Empire could lead to significant changes in anti-monopoly actions and tax policies. The article also explores the idea of three competing empires in the Eurasian megacontinent: European, Islamic, and Chinese (or Christian, Islamic, and Confucian). It argues that conflicts in the world can be categorized as battles between empires or battles within empires. The rise of China is seen as reopening old fissures of empire and leading to a more nationalist and religious aspect in politics. The article predicts a future geopolitical battle between the European, Islamic, Confucian, and Hindu worlds. It suggests that nationalism and religion will become more important in geopolitics, and the rise of a Hindu empire in India will have significant implications. The article concludes by stating that religion and nationalism are the geopolitical tectonic plates of the world, and India's role in this new plate will likely lead to a geopolitical earthquake.</p>

The author suggests that the Federal Reserve may have made a mistake by not pausing interest rate increases, considering the deeply inverted US bond market, which is typically seen as a sign of "over-tightening" by the Federal Reserve. The article also mentions that previous instances of yield inversion have preceded financial problems. The author further points out various indicators that suggest the economy is starting to decline.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Skillz Inc. is a Las Vegas-based company that has created an ecosystem where players can compete in mobile games for rewards. The company provides developers with the necessary tools to integrate the Skillz technology suite into their games. However, Skillz has been facing challenges with its business model. The company's revenue has been declining, and its growth has been heavily reliant on sales and marketing spend. The high churn rate of mobile gamers and the lack of brand loyalty for Skillz are contributing factors to the company's struggles. Additionally, some of the games promoted by Skillz have faced regulatory concerns due to the presence of luck-based elements. Skillz has outstanding debt and negative cash flow, which raises concerns about its financial stability. The company's performance has been compared unfavorably to DraftKings Inc., another deSPAC company led by the same team. Overall, Skillz's flawed business model and lack of barriers to entry pose significant challenges for its future success.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Federal Reserve surprised markets by signaling a conviction for "higher for longer" interest rates, contrary to previous expectations of a "soft landing." The Fed's dot plot projections for 2023 remained unchanged, but forecasts for 2024 and 2025 were revised upward, indicating a longer period of higher rates. This announcement led to negative reactions in the equity market and increased bond yields. The consumer sector is also facing challenges, with declining consumer confidence and a decrease in credit card spending. The Conference Board reported a 10.5% decline in its consumer index, a pattern not seen since the Great Financial Crisis. Additionally, household credit card spending declined, and delinquency rates are increasing. The article suggests that the talk of a soft landing and recession avoidance may have been wishful thinking. In terms of bankruptcy filings, there have been some cases, but the focus is primarily on smaller to middle-market companies, while larger debt stack cases focus on liability management and out-of-court deals.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the changing landscape of competition for early-stage startups in the fintech industry. In the past, startups primarily competed against traditional incumbents, but now they also face competition from "neo incumbents," which are large tech startups and companies that are entirely digital, agile, and innovative. The author highlights that early-stage startups can no longer rely on simply offering a better digital experience or faster execution to differentiate themselves. Instead, they need to focus on their core product offerings and find opportunities to launch new, innovative, and risky products with a better user experience. The article emphasizes that this small window of opportunity will not last long, as market sentiment shifts back to positive, so early-stage startups need to act quickly to capture a critical mass of users. The author concludes by asking early-stage startup founders to share their thoughts on competition and how they communicate their value proposition to users.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the role of financial advisors in managing the wealth of millionaires in America. Financial advisors not only require expertise in financial planning and investment knowledge but also a mastery of psychology to understand clients' diverse relationships with money. The article highlights the personal nature of the job, where clients' relationships are typically with their advisor rather than the firm. Unlike employees in the institutional segment of the industry, financial advisors have been able to command a stable or increasing share of revenue. They are paid an explicit share of the revenue they bring in, which has led to their ability to negotiate higher compensation and even sign-on bonuses. The individualized nature of the business creates challenges for large firms, as financial advisors can build up autonomy and take clients with them when they switch firms. The article also discusses the history of regulations and agreements regarding client poaching and compensation. Despite the challenges, wealth management is considered attractive due to its lower capital intensity and stability compared to the institutional securities business.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The S&P 500 index has announced two changes to its composition, with Lincoln National and Newell Brands being removed and Airbnb and Blackstone being added. This change is significant because Blackstone's inclusion highlights its success in the insurance market, where it has been making waves with its Insurance Solutions division. While Lincoln National and Blackstone don't directly compete, their approaches to the market reflect divergent economics in the insurance value chain. Blackstone's celebration of its inclusion on social media contrasts with the potentially downbeat mood at Lincoln's headquarters. This change in the S&P 500 composition sheds light on the changing face of the US insurance industry.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The recent collapse in the price of US long-term bonds and the spike in yields has significant implications for the economy. The sudden change in Treasury rates could have repercussions in areas such as bank lending and the housing market. The forced liquidations by investors who were still holding onto US Treasuries have led to steep losses and may impact lending and housing starts. It is important to closely monitor these areas for any negative effects from the Treasury crash. While current economic data still points to higher nominal and real growth, the crash in long-term US Treasuries needs to be closely watched for any potential consequences on the current growth trajectory. In terms of market outlook, oversold conditions may lead to a short-term equity bounce, but the weight of the Treasury implosion is likely to have a lasting impact. The author plans to re-engage in US value when market stress is high enough to provide a margin of safety. However, they emphasize the need to continuously assess the data and sentiment in order to make informed investment decisions.</p>

                        <h1>The Fate of the SPY and $400b+ Rests in the Hands of 11 Ordinary Individuals</h1>
                        <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.investmenttalk.co/p/the-fate-of-the-spy-and-400b-rests" class="link" target="_blank">https://www.investmenttalk.co/p/the-fate-of-the-spy-and-400b-rests</a></p>
                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The fate of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), the world's largest exchange-traded fund (ETF), lies in the hands of eleven ordinary people. This is due to a quirk in the legal structure used to set up the fund, which dictates that it will terminate 20 years after the death of the last survivor of the eleven individuals named in the trust agreement. The fund, launched in 1993, has amassed $400 billion in assets under management. ETFs were initially met with resistance from asset managers, but their popularity grew as they offered passive, liquid, indexed funds at a low cost. The SPY was the catalyst for an explosion in ETF creation and adoption. Over the years, ETFs expanded to offer exposure to various asset classes and themes. The SPY's termination is unlikely to impact anyone in the near future, and there may be a transition process in place when the time comes. The story of the SPY's creation is an arcane piece of historical stock market trivia.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The lymphatic system is often overlooked in modern medicine, despite its important role in detoxification. Detoxification refers to the process of eliminating harmful substances and waste products from the body. While the liver is commonly associated with detoxification, other organs such as the kidneys, stomach, gallbladder, pancreas, and bowels also play a role. The lymphatic system, which runs alongside the circulatory system, is responsible for transporting fluid and waste products back into circulation. Maintaining a healthy lymphatic system is crucial for overall health. To promote effective lymphatic drainage, it is important to move the body regularly. Techniques such as lymphatic breathing, lymphatic massage, lymphatic stretching, and lymphatic pumping can also help improve lymphatic flow. These techniques can be done at home or with the assistance of trained professionals. Improving lymphatic flow can benefit conditions such as edema and can be especially important after surgery. Incorporating these techniques into a daily routine and staying active can support optimal lymphatic drainage and overall detoxification.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The latest Weekly S&P500 #ChartStorm provides insights and conclusions from various charts. The S&P 500 closed down 4.9% in September, marking its second monthly decline in a row. Financial conditions have tightened significantly, but there has been an initial climax in these moves. Medium-term bull market signals from margin debt and sentiment remain intact. The equity risk premium suggests that cash may outperform equities over the next three years. UK railway stocks in the 1800s serve as a reminder that technological revolutions aren't always kind to investors. Technically, the market looks primed for a rebound, but the sharp tightening of financial conditions and bigger picture technical deterioration suggest skepticism on the sustainability of any short-term bounce. The article also discusses basing breadth, correction drivers, seasonal shifts, bull market signals, rates and valuations, and the performance of global vs US equities. It concludes with a reminder that winning technology does not always translate to winning investments, using the example of British railway stocks in the 1800s.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Weekly S&P500 #ChartStorm provides insights and conclusions from various charts. Key takeaways include indicators showing oversold conditions and approaching support levels, but financial conditions tightening remains a concern. Seasonally, some weakness is expected, and medium-term macro downside signals are mounting. The 60/40 portfolio is struggling due to low yields and high valuation scores. Investors looking to buy the dip should exercise patience as the correction runs its course. Trigger points to watch include the 4300 zone, peak yields, the US dollar, and energy prices. Micro cap stocks breaking support could signal bearish risks. The last interest rate hike of the cycle historically leads to stock rallies, but a recession could reverse this trend. The rate of change in job openings suggests softening, adding to macro downside risks. Interest expense is increasing, putting pressure on earnings. Bond yields now offer almost 3x the yield income of stocks. The 60/40 portfolio's combined yield remains low, and valuation indicators for stocks and bonds are slightly expensive.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> China's valuation compared to the USA is explored in this article. The author uses a blended PE ratio, which combines the PE10, trailing PE, and forward PE, to analyze the valuations. The article suggests that China is currently undervalued compared to its historical levels and compared to the USA. The author acknowledges the risks associated with investing in China, such as geopolitical risk and regulatory risk, but argues that these risks are already priced into the low valuations. The article concludes that valuation indicators can be seen as both sentiment indicators and fundamental indicators, and currently, they indicate that investors are confident in the USA and pessimistic about China.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The author of the article responds to a dispute with Matt Yglesias regarding the polarization of American politics. The author argues that the Republican Party has become an extreme-right party, comparable to Fidesz in Hungary, while the Democratic Party remains a moderate party of the center and center-left. The author criticizes an article by Yglesias titled "Polarization is a choice," stating that it promotes a false equivalence between the two parties. The author asserts that the polarization in American politics is primarily driven by the radicalization of the Republican Party and the influence of right-wing media. They argue that the assumption of a contest for the middle ground between two normal political parties is fundamentally wrong. The author concludes by mentioning the existence of the 2025 Project, which aims to establish a permanent right-wing dictatorship, as evidence of where the polarization is truly coming from.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Chemical company Croda's shares have fallen 15% since June, reaching their lowest point since May 2020. However, Librarian Capital believes that the shares have limited downside and potential for significant upside. The company's 2023 earnings are expected to be a cyclical low due to post-COVID customer de-stocking and the shrinkage of vaccine-related sales. Croda's full H1 2023 results have shown some positive signs, with Consumer Care volumes starting to improve and the weakening of the UK Pound providing a tailwind. Near-term sales remain uncertain, but the company's long-term bull case includes a rebound in EPS in 2024 and mid-to-high single-digit growth. Additionally, there is a possibility of Croda being acquired by a strategic buyer at a significant premium. Librarian Capital reiterates its Buy rating on Croda, with a base case of 58% upside by the end of 2026.</p>

The company's shares have fallen 18% year-to-date, and its adjusted EBIT rebounded 41% in the first half of the year. Maintenance sales are growing steadily, and modernization sales are picking up pace. Despite a weak Chinese construction market, Kone is expected to achieve mid-single-digit EPS growth. The company's guidance for 2023 implies a large recovery in adjusted EBIT. However, there has been a decline in new equipment orders, particularly in China. Nevertheless, Kone's exposure to China has decreased, and maintenance sales in the country are growing rapidly. The stock is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 22.8x, and it is expected to return 47% by the end of 2026. The upside potential would be even greater if there is a rebound in the Chinese property sector. Overall, Kone is considered an attractive investment opportunity.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Using ChatGPT for stock picking is not effective based on research. While ChatGPT outperforms traditional sentiment analysis tools in evaluating financial news, it underperforms simple methods like regression and random forests for stock picks using historical data. However, ChatGPT is excellent at understanding context and nuances, and researchers have developed a long-short strategy using ChatGPT that generated a 550% return by using it to evaluate the sentiment of news surrounding companies. This strategy outperformed the market during a period when the S&P 500 was down. ChatGPT's ability to understand complex financial nuances could enhance the performance of quantitative trading strategies.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A study by researchers from Stanford and New York University found that, on average, 58% of pre-merger equity in Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) goes into servicing the SPAC, leaving only $4.2 for the target company for acquisition. Most of these costs are borne by SPAC shareholders. SPACs also create dysfunctional incentives for sponsors, who can make significant profits even if the SPAC underperforms. The overall costs incurred by SPACs can vary based on the quality of sponsors. The biggest flaw of SPACs is that sponsors only get rewarded if a merger is completed, creating a conflict of interest. Research shows that sponsors can do well even if SPAC investors do poorly. The article highlights Chamath Palihapitiya as an example, whose company made $750 million through SPACs while the actual stock performance was not as impressive. The current incentive structure forces sponsors to make deals, and the outcome is consistent with their incentives.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Nobel Laureate economist Paul Samuelson played a significant role in the creation of the index fund, providing the confidence for John Bogle to launch the first index fund in 1976. Academic research has often been ahead of industry, such as Rolf Banz's 1982 report showing consistently higher risk-adjusted returns for small stocks. Following academic research can give investors a competitive edge in creating alpha-generating strategies. However, keeping up with the vast amount of academic papers published each year is challenging. The article highlights several impactful developments in the investing space from academia, including using ChatGPT to forecast stock price movements, the costs associated with SPAC deals, the outperformance of equal-weighted portfolios, the diversification benefits of commodities depending on the investor's country, and the importance of international diversification for U.S. investors. The article emphasizes the need to stay informed about emerging trends and innovative investment strategies by following academic research.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Six Palestinian citizens of Israel have been killed in two separate incidents, raising concerns about a crime wave in the country's Arab areas. Five members of the same family were shot dead in the north of the country, while another man was killed in Haifa. This brings the total number of Palestinian citizens of Israel murdered this year to 188. In Burkina Faso, the military rulers, who came to power in a coup last year, have claimed to have foiled another coup plot. Four army officers have been arrested, and others are being pursued. Burkina Faso has been grappling with a growing Islamist insurgency, resulting in approximately 6,000 deaths this year alone. Meanwhile, in Bangladesh, nearly 1,000 people have died from dengue in recent weeks. The mosquito-borne virus is the world's fastest-spreading tropical disease, and experts believe that extremely wet monsoon seasons have contributed to its rapid spread. Climate change and global warming have been identified as factors that could lead to a surge in dengue cases and pose a pandemic risk.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> At least 120 people have died in a fire at a wedding in Iraq, possibly caused by the use of fireworks. The death toll may rise as funerals have already begun. Flammable material may have been used in the construction of the wedding venue. In Nagorno-Karabakh, over a third of the ethnic Armenian population has fled to Armenia after Azerbaijani forces took control of the enclave. Many fear ethnic cleansing now that it is under Azeri control. Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but has an overwhelmingly Armenian population. In Mali, an armed group linked to al-Qaeda claims to be in control of an army base in Timbuktu, although the military denies this. Mali has been battling groups with al-Qaeda and ISIS links for years, and the military rulers ordered UN peacekeepers to leave the country in June.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Eight current and former officials have been arrested in Libya following a flooding disaster in the city of Derna that killed thousands of people. The officials, including former mayor Abdulmenam al-Ghaithi, are being investigated for their role in the collapse of two dams after heavy rains caused by Storm Daniel. In Egypt, presidential elections are set to be held in December, with President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi expected to extend his time in power until 2030. The country is currently facing a dire economic situation, with inflation reaching a record high of 39.7 percent in August. Meanwhile, in Zambia, former president Edgar Lungu has been warned by the police against jogging in public, as they consider it "political activism." Lungu's workouts have attracted supporters of his party, fueling speculation that he plans to run for the presidency again in 2026. Despite the warning, Lungu's lawyer stated that he will continue jogging without notifying the police.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Hundreds of ethnic Armenians are fleeing Nagorno-Karabakh for Armenia after Azerbaijani forces defeated the breakaway region. Although Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, the majority of its inhabitants are ethnically Armenian. Azerbaijan claims it wants to integrate the ethnic Armenians and guarantee their rights, but many fear persecution. The leadership of Nagorno-Karabakh expects most of the 120,000 population to leave for Armenia. In Somalia, the death toll from a truck bomb explosion in Beledweyne has risen to 21. The al-Shabab armed group, which has been fighting the government for over a decade, is suspected of carrying out the attack. Al-Shabab has been pushed out of much of the territory it once controlled and has increased hit-and-run attacks in response. In China, a Uyghur scholar has been sentenced to life in prison for "endangering state security." Rahile Dawut, an expert on Uyghur folklore and traditions, disappeared in 2017 as part of the Chinese state's crackdown on the Uyghur community. The Uyghur community has faced imprisonment and alleged human rights abuses in what China calls "re-education camps."</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> More than 20 students, mostly female, have been kidnapped in northern Nigeria by armed gangs known as bandits. The students were taken from their university accommodation in Zamfara state, where kidnapping for ransom has been a recurring issue. Despite pressure from locals, authorities have been unable to stop the gangs from operating. In 2021, over 300 schoolgirls were abducted in a single incident in Zamfara but were later released after negotiations with the kidnappers. In Haiti, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has proposed deploying a Kenya-led international force to help the country deal with its escalating gang problem. Following the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021, criminal gangs now control more than 80% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Blinken has urged the UN Security Council to authorize the mission, with the US offering financial and logistical assistance. In the UK, a lock of hair from a deceased Ethiopian prince, Prince Alemayehu, was handed over to representatives of Ethiopia. The prince was abducted by the British military in 1868 and died at the age of 18. Despite requests to return his body, Buckingham Palace has refused, citing potential disturbance to other buried bodies.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A report from dappGambl, a crypto-gambling platform, reveals that 95% of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) purchased during the peak of the 2021 crypto boom have lost value. The study highlights the volatility and speculative nature of the NFT market, with many buyers experiencing significant losses. The example of entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, who bought an NFT of an ape wearing an orange hat for $5.9 million only to see it become worthless two years later, illustrates this trend. The research suggests that the NFT market is highly unpredictable and caution should be exercised when investing in these digital assets.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Rupert Murdoch is stepping down as chairman of Fox Corporation and passing the baton to his son, Lachlan Murdoch. However, Rupert will still maintain control over the company, which has faced scandals and a decline in share price. Fox News, despite its controversies, is a successful media business with high profits and viewership. The shares are undervalued, but the gap is unlikely to close unless there are significant changes. Investors tend to devalue companies they perceive as ethically dubious, and Fox is seen by some as the media version of cigarettes. The rise of woke-investing further hinders the company's image. In another report, it is revealed that most non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are worthless, with 95% of them having no value. The NFT craze is unlikely to return.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Hong Kong is facing challenges in its international comeback, with concerns about the erosion of its judiciary independence and a decline in home prices and stock market activity. To restore confidence and enhance its appeal as a global financial center, Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu must be bold and creative in his action plan. One major issue that needs to be addressed is the housing problem, with many people still living in cramped conditions. Hong Kong can learn from Beijing's approach to eradicating poverty, where personal responsibility and mobilization were key. Lee should adopt a whole-of-government approach and develop a new housing policy and holistic plan to help the city's poor. The argument that a rise in public housing supply would depress private home prices is tired and hollow, as seen in Singapore's successful model. Additionally, Hong Kong must do more to explain the beauty of "two systems" to the outside world and use its influence to lobby the central government to rethink policies that directly impact the city.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin of Thailand is moving forward with a debt moratorium plan to help millions of farmers. The plan, approved by the cabinet, will allocate 12 billion baht to cover interest on loans held by around 2.7 million farmers. The moratorium will last for three years and cost the government around 30 billion baht. Move Forward, a political party in Thailand, has named Chaithawat Tulathon as its new leader after the previous leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, was forced to step down. Former Move Forward MP Pannika Wanich has been banned from politics for life due to an online post made 13 years ago that was found to be disrespectful to the monarchy. In Myanmar, a 21-year-old political prisoner named Min Hein Khant died of a heart attack in Insein Prison. The prisoner had been hospitalized for a heart condition that developed after his incarceration. Prime Minister Hun Manet of Cambodia addressed the United Nations General Assembly and claimed that the recent elections in Cambodia were "free and fair." Voice of Democracy, an independent news outlet in Cambodia, is relaunching in the US after being shut down by the government. The outlet will provide content for Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok. The BBC has published a report on the Dara Sakor Seashore Resort, a Chinese-backed tourism site in Cambodia that has faced criticism for displacing villagers and causing environmental degradation. The US and Vietnam are reportedly discussing an arms deal, which could strain relations with China. In Vietnam, a music lecturer named Dang Dang Phuoc lost a challenge in court and was convicted of spreading information opposing the state.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the potential consolidation of the Southeast Asia tech industry, specifically in the sectors of e-commerce, food delivery, and buy now, pay later (BNPL). In the e-commerce sector, there is a prediction that only 2-3 major players will remain, with Shopee and Lazada being the most likely survivors. The article also mentions the impact of TikTok's separation of its social and shopping functions in Indonesia, which may lead to a decrease in its market share. In the food delivery sector, there is speculation that Grab may acquire foodpanda, leading to significant consolidation and increased market share for Grab. The article also briefly touches on the BNPL sector, noting a lack of aggressive expansion and a focus on local markets. Overall, the article suggests that consolidation in these sectors could lead to less expensive growth, increased profitability, and a better customer experience in the Southeast Asia tech industry.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The author offers three lessons based on observations over a half century. The first lesson is to find your life's work and not choose a career solely based on earnings potential. The author recommends reaching financial independence at an early age but emphasizes the importance of doing so in a line of work that is interesting and fulfilling. The second lesson discusses two philosophical razors: Hanlon's Razor and Occam's Razor. Hanlon's Razor advises giving people the benefit of the doubt and not assuming malice when their actions are objectionable. Occam's Razor suggests defaulting to simple explanations when they adequately describe a situation. The author explains that both razors can coexist but emphasizes the need to adapt our views when a pattern of behavior indicates malice. The third lesson explores the futility of hatred and the potential damage it can cause. The author suggests striving for indifference instead of descending into hatred and recommends disassociating from toxic people and situations. The author concludes by highlighting the importance of experience and sharing these lessons with others.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the historical narrative of inflation from the 1960s to the 1980s and how the perception of high inflation persisted even after it started to decline. The article includes a chart showing the yield on the ten-year treasury since 1962, highlighting that the current yield of around 4.5% is relatively low from a historical perspective. It mentions that double-digit inflation did not return after the early-1980s spike, and yields began a long multi-decade decline. Warren Buffett's surprise at the taming of inflation during the 1980s is also mentioned. The article emphasizes the importance of reading about past experiences to gain insight into historical events. It refers to Warren Buffett's letters to shareholders and focuses on his comments regarding owning capital-light businesses with pricing power during inflationary times. The article concludes with a quote from Warren Buffett about the traditional wisdom of inflation protection and asset-heavy businesses.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Warren Buffett's views on bonds in the early 1970s are examined in part one of this series. In 1970, municipal bonds offered attractive tax-exempt yields of around 6.5%, which was higher than usual. However, yields continued to rise in the following months. The article also highlights the impact of inflation during this period, with double-digit inflation eroding the purchasing power of coupons and principal for bond investors. Warren Buffett frequently discussed inflation in his annual letters to shareholders during the 1970s. The article then shifts focus to Berkshire Hathaway's acquisition of Home & Automobile Insurance Company in 1971. The company specialized in auto insurance in Cook County, Illinois, and had a premium volume of $7.5 million at the time. The purchase price is unknown, but Buffett was willing to pay a $364,000 premium over the net assets of the business.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized the field of protein structure prediction, allowing scientists to determine the 3D structure of proteins in a matter of minutes. The breakthrough came with the introduction of AlphaFold, an AI system developed by DeepMind, which achieved high accuracy in predicting protein structures. AlphaFold2, based on a transformer model, surpassed its predecessor in accuracy and was widely recognized by the scientific community. The annual Albert Lasker Foundation Basic Medical Research Award was recently awarded to AlphaFold for its significant contributions. The use of AI in protein structure prediction has led to breakthroughs in various areas of life science, including the design of molecular syringes for targeted drug delivery, the cracking of the 3D structure of the nuclear pore complex, and the design of complex protein structures. However, it is important to note that AI models like AlphaFold are not perfect and have limitations in certain areas. Nevertheless, transformer models have shown their potential in transforming various fields beyond protein prediction, such as predicting missense mutations, RNA structure, and gene networks. The impact of transformer AI models in life science has been profound and may even warrant future recognition, such as a Nobel Prize.</p>

                        <h1>The FDA Is Wasting Its Time Chasing Cigars</h1>
                        <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://invariant.substack.com/p/the-fda-is-wasting-its-time-chasing" class="link" target="_blank">https://invariant.substack.com/p/the-fda-is-wasting-its-time-chasing</a></p>
                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The United States Department of Justice has filed a notice of appeal on behalf of the FDA in a long-running dispute over the regulation of premium cigars. In July 2022, a court ruled that the FDA's decision to regulate premium cigars was arbitrary and capricious because it failed to consider relevant data on their use and health effects. The FDA's decision to appeal the ruling is puzzling, considering that premium cigars make up a small fraction of tobacco products in the US and have low underage usage. If the appeal is successful, the status quo will be maintained, with premium cigars remaining under FDA regulation. However, if the appeal fails, new premium handmade cigar products will no longer be bound by regulatory requirements, allowing for greater variety and competition. Scandinavian Tobacco Group (STG), a major player in the premium cigar industry, stands to benefit from both outcomes. If the appeal succeeds, STG's exceptional portfolio of products will continue to be protected from new competition. If the appeal fails, STG can leverage its expertise and infrastructure to introduce innovative blends and expand its offerings, catering to a wider range of consumer preferences.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Ultima Online, released in 1997, is considered one of the greatest video games ever created and a pioneer in the MMORPG genre. It allowed players to explore an open world with no main storyline and no defined class archetypes, giving them the freedom to mix and match skills. The game also had a complex economy, with players taking on roles as crafters to meet the demand for weapons and supplies. Ultima Online's development team attempted to create a balanced ecological system within the game, but players quickly disrupted it by killing all the animals for their resources. This taught the team a valuable lesson about the unpredictability of player behavior and the need for real-world testing. The article concludes that even in a simple closed system like a video game, it is difficult to account for the human variable and the unintended consequences of design choices.</p>

However, the article argues that these alternative chips may not be able to match the performance of the Kirin 9000 chip. The article also highlights the importance of memory chips in the overall performance of smartphones and the potential consequences of Huawei's chip shortage. Overall, the article emphasizes the significance of the Kirin 9000 chip in the memory market and the challenges Huawei is facing due to the US sanctions.</p>

                        <h1>Fraud at Georgetown Finance Shakes the Foundation of the Corporate Bond Literature</h1>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses a scandal in the corporate bond literature, where a paper published in the Journal of Financial Economics (JFE) is found to have major errors and potential fraud. The paper, authored by Jennie Bai, Turan Bali, and Quan Wen, contains a lead-lag error and surreptitious winsorization, which distort the results. The errors were exposed by another group of researchers, Dickerson, Mueller, and Robotti, who published a paper in JFE highlighting the mistakes in the original paper. The JFE retracted the fraudulent paper and published the correct factors. However, the extent of the impact of this scandal is significant, as many published and working papers have relied on the fraudulent factors, raising questions about the validity of a vast body of academic work. The response from Georgetown, where the authors are professors, and the academic community at large has been criticized for lack of transparency and action. The article calls for further investigation and accountability to restore the integrity of academic research in finance.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Thousands of economists will have to return to Twitter or find a new platform as the Mastodon server, a popular alternative to Twitter, is being shut down. The reason for the shutdown is believed to be a mass-doxxing campaign and an alleged IP honeytrap blackmail scheme. The evidence of this scheme is expected to be destroyed, unless it is subpoenaed. The shutdown of the Mastodon server will force economists to find alternative platforms for communication and networking.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Three professors from Yale University, Dr. Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham, Dr. Florian Ederer, and Dr. Kyle Jensen, hacked the website econjobrumors.com and stole millions of IP addresses. The hack is considered unethical and illegal, as there was a reasonable expectation of privacy for users of the site. The professors claim to be "white hat hackers," but their actions are seen as gray-hat or even black-hat hacking. The owner of econjobrumors.com and economist Dr. Tyler Cowen agree that the hack took place. The author of the article argues that the professors should be arrested and criminally charged, and lawsuits should be brought against Yale. The author also raises concerns about the professors' ownership of the EconTwitter mastodon server and the potential for further legal liability. The hack has already caused psychological distress to some individuals, and there are worries about the safety of Chinese and Turkish dissidents who posted criticism on the site. The author questions why the Yale Institutional Review Board did not respond to complaints and requests for human subjects paperwork.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Matt Wimble, a former user of the Economics Job Market Rumors (EJMR) forum, claims that he was included in a study on suicide without his approval or knowledge. He has requested the human subjects paperwork from the study's authors but has been refused. Wimble believes there are violations of the Nuremberg Code in the study. He also accuses Florian Ederer, a professor at Boston University and one of the authors, of being a coward. Wimble, who has experienced a tenure denial and a suicide attempt, credits the EJMR community for helping him recover. He plans to move back to Michigan to be with his family and heal his daughter. Wimble criticizes the use of tax dollars for the study and suggests that some of the authors may have national security clearances.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A micro-cap company with a market capitalization of less than $100 million is showing strong growth potential. The company has achieved industry-leading same-store sales growth in its key brand, with core brand system revenue increasing by 16% in fiscal year 2023 compared to the previous year. The CEO has a successful track record of execution, and the company has seen a 28% year-over-year increase in EBITDA and operating income when adjusted for PPP forgiveness in 2022. Additionally, the company has repurchased 20% of its outstanding shares and has a cash reserve equal to approximately 20% of its market cap, with zero debt. The management is focusing on the core business, improving unit economics through low-cost product innovation, and restarting growth with new store openings. If the bullish hypothesis is correct, the company has the potential to be a substantial multibagger, with a 10X increase in value over the long term. However, investors should consider the limited liquidity and risk/volatility associated with investing in sub $100 million market cap companies.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article criticizes the notion that a shift to green energy and collective sacrifice will save the planet from climate change. It argues that Western leaders have failed to balance the needs of the majority with the desires of a vocal minority. The article highlights the declining capital in developed markets and questions whether emerging markets will share the burden of energy transition. It also mentions the reliance on fossil fuels and the potential consequences of neglecting green energy. The author suggests that the market will eventually expose faulty notions and that energy security requires long-term capital investment. The article concludes by stating that this is just the beginning and implies that the current approach to climate change may not be sustainable.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the potential impact of rising interest rates and inflation on the market. It highlights that inflation expectations are not currently high, but factors such as rising housing and durable goods costs could contribute to higher inflation rates. Additionally, the article mentions the possibility of energy prices increasing due to geopolitical factors. The author suggests that inflation may not settle around the 2% level and that rates are creeping higher due to the need for investors to absorb government debt. The article concludes that if interest rates continue to rise, asset prices may need to adjust accordingly.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A recent study by Bryan Hardy and Sonya Zhu examines changes in bank deposit funding following a regional bank panic earlier this year. The study reveals that non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) substituted for the non-financial sector as providers of deposit funding to internationally active banks in the first quarter of 2023. This shift was globally modest but concentrated in a few countries. Additionally, deposits in the United States shifted to money market funds, which led to increased dollar lending to banks outside the United States. The study also highlights that the growth in deposit funding in major jurisdictions slowed down, with negative year-on-year growth in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. The authors suggest that these changes in deposit funding can have implications for financial stability.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> China's demographic dividend, which fueled economic growth from the 1990s to 2010, has come to an end, and the country now faces the risk of a reverse demographic dividend. The working-age population is set to decline, while the population aged 65 and over will more than double by 2055. The decline in China's birth rate, which reached a new low in 2022, is contributing to this demographic challenge. However, a lower birth rate in the short term can have a positive impact on the economy by reducing the dependency ratio. China's innovation and productivity, as well as its society and governance, are the other two pillars of wealth creation that can counteract the demographic disadvantage. China has made significant progress in innovation, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence, and has invested heavily in infrastructure. However, there are concerns about the efficiency of converting innovation into wealth due to regulatory uncertainties and recent governance decisions. China's recent foreign policy and military buildup have also strained its relationships with neighboring countries and its most important trading partner, the United States. These factors have created uncertainty for China's economic future and foreign investors.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the changing retail and F&B landscape in Moscow, Russia, as a result of geopolitical tensions and economic sanctions. Foreign chains like KFC, Burger King, and Subway are still operating, but local alternatives like Vkusno I Tochka (a rebranded version of McDonald's) are gaining popularity. High-end Western clothing brands have left the country, creating opportunities for local Russian fashion brands like Sportmaster and Gloria Jeans. The Russian fashion market is undergoing a reset, with a shift towards department and multi-brand stores. E-commerce is experiencing explosive growth, with companies like Wildberries and Ozon leading the way. Wildberries operates as a hybrid model with online retail and offline pickup points, while Ozon is a pure-play online retailer. Both companies have seen significant growth in revenue and market share. The article also mentions the challenges and opportunities in the e-commerce sector in Russia.</p>

                        <h1>Xi Reduces Role of Private Firms, Hurts Innovation</h1>
                        <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://richardkatz.substack.com/p/xi-reduces-role-of-private-firms" class="link" target="_blank">https://richardkatz.substack.com/p/xi-reduces-role-of-private-firms</a></p>
                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> China's push for innovation through subsidies for patents has resulted in an explosion of low-quality patents, hindering the country's overall innovation and productivity growth. President Xi Jinping's revival of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and increased control over private companies further dampens China's economic potential. SOEs have lower returns on assets compared to private firms, and their performance continues to decline. The shift in investment towards SOEs limits the growth of more productive private companies. Xi's actions also reduce the efficiency of private firms, as their returns on assets are shrinking. The CCP's increasing influence in private companies and the integration of Party leadership into corporate governance further hinder the dynamism of the private sector. This trend is particularly concerning in provinces where SOEs play a larger role in the economy. Overall, Xi's policies undermine China's growth potential and living standards, as the country's investment remains inefficient and the trade-off between growth and living standards worsens.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> China's Belt and Road megaproject, which aimed to invest in infrastructure projects worldwide, has been a failure. Instead of investing, China has been loaning money to countries to build infrastructure projects, often using Chinese contractors. Many of these projects have been poorly planned and executed, leading to protests and economic problems in the borrowing countries. China's government has realized the failures of the Belt and Road and has stopped lending, leaving the borrowing countries with a significant amount of debt. China has forgiven some of the debt but has also been intransigent in cooperating with other lenders to provide rescue packages for struggling countries. This has led to resentment and distrust towards China. The Belt and Road has not only been a financial failure but also a strategic mistake for China, as it has damaged its image and undermined its goal of being a leader in the Global South. China's approach to the Belt and Road has been akin to a mafia loanshark, taking as much money as possible and leaving developing countries bitter and resentful.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses five interesting topics. First, it highlights the improvement in working-class wealth in the US, with the bottom 50% of households experiencing strong wealth growth in real terms since 2012. Second, it explores the increasing health inequality in America, particularly among those without college degrees, as evidenced by declining life expectancies. Third, it examines the rise of zero-sum thinking in the US, as shown by a survey that indicates younger Americans have a higher index of zero-sum thinking compared to older generations. Fourth, it emphasizes the challenges of obtaining accurate economic data, citing examples of historical GDP per capita estimates and discrepancies in energy price indices. Finally, it addresses the distinction between indigenous knowledge and science, asserting that while indigenous knowledge is valuable, it is not equivalent to science due to differences in transferability and testability.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> President Biden recently made history by joining striking UAW workers near Detroit, solidifying his image as a champion of the working class. This comes as part of a larger labor revival in the US, with major strikes happening across various industries. The labor revival has the support of the Biden Administration and the American people, as unions are more popular than they have been in decades. However, the UAW strike may face challenges due to the ongoing shift from internal combustion cars to electric vehicles in the auto industry. This shift will reduce the importance of traditional heavily unionized industry clusters like Detroit and transform the nature of auto manufacturing. The ability of US institutions, including car companies, the government, and labor, to adapt to these changes will determine whether union-friendly states can avoid a new version of the Rust Belt. Electric vehicles are expected to dominate the marketplace in the next couple of decades.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the shortcomings of America's socialist movement and Bernie Sanders' campaign. The author criticizes the socialists for their obsession with power and factionalism, which led them to focus on attacking Democrats and progressives who weren't part of their faction. The author argues that Bernie and his supporters missed the opportunity to create a real grassroots movement and instead bungled it. However, the problems that fueled the socialist movement, such as expensive healthcare, inequality, high student debt, and climate change, still exist. The author proposes more realistic versions of four of Bernie's ideas: Medicare for All, a wealth tax, student debt cancellation, and the Green New Deal. For universal healthcare, the author suggests using a system like Japan's, which would address the high costs of American healthcare. The author also argues that the focus should be on reducing hidden healthcare costs rather than eliminating out-of-pocket costs. Overall, the author believes that while the socialist movement had its flaws, some of their ideas can be refined and implemented effectively to address the country's major issues.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Xi Jinping, the leader of China, is facing criticism for his handling of various issues, including the country's economic slowdown, diplomatic blunders, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Critics argue that Xi's personal objections to certain economic policies and his ideological preference for austerity have hindered efforts to stimulate China's economy. Additionally, Xi's growing paranoia and series of purges of his own officials have caused turmoil within China's leadership. Internationally, Xi's aggressive and bellicose approach has alienated neighboring countries and led to a negative perception of China. Furthermore, China's "zero COVID" policy and reliance on domestically produced vaccines have been met with challenges and have contributed to economic difficulties. Overall, there are concerns about Xi's competence as a leader and the impact of his decisions on China's future. However, given his consolidation of power and the lack of alternatives, it is unlikely that Xi will step down voluntarily.</p>

                        <h1>Why do economists get paid more than sociologists?</h1>
                        <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-do-economists-get-paid-more-than" class="link" target="_blank">https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-do-economists-get-paid-more-than</a></p>
                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Economists tend to make higher salaries than sociologists, and there are various reasons for this disparity. One explanation is the difference in supply and demand. Economists have fewer people interested in becoming economists compared to sociologists, which means that universities have to pay economists more to attract them. Additionally, economists have more outside options, such as working in the private sector as consultants or data scientists, which increases their bargaining power and allows them to command higher salaries. Another factor is the higher demand for economics classes from undergraduates, particularly business majors. Universities may be more desperate to hire economists to meet this demand, leading to higher salaries for economists. However, it is challenging to determine the true story behind the salary differential between economists and sociologists, as it requires empirical testing and matching theoretical models to data. Nonetheless, understanding market forces and social factors can shed light on the reasons behind the salary gap.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The recently enacted Digital Services Act (DSA) in the European Union (EU) poses a significant threat to freedom of speech. Under the DSA, the European Commission has the power to restrict citizens' ability to engage in democratic discourse on digital platforms. The Act empowers the Commission to pressure platforms to curb "hate speech," "disinformation," and threats to "civic discourse," which are vague and subjective categories. The legislation gives the Commission discretionary powers to oversee content moderation policies, effectively holding freedom of speech hostage to the ideological preferences of unelected officials. The Act also creates "trusted flaggers" who can report illegal content, and platforms are required to prioritize their reports. Non-compliance with the Act can result in hefty fines, and periodic audits by the Commission can pressure platforms to police speech in a way that aligns with the Commission's preferred narrative. The Act grants the Commission broad power and discretion, allowing it to declare emergencies and demand interventions by platforms. The DSA lacks clear definitions and checks and balances, making it a potential weapon for the Commission's political agenda. Overall, the Act undermines freedom of expression and places too much power in the hands of unelected officials.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Gold miners are currently undervalued and present a buying opportunity, according to the author. They argue that gold has multiple factors supporting its value, including its role as real money, a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risk, and the hoarding of gold by nations like China and Russia. The author emphasizes the importance of timing when investing in gold and mentions their intention to buy it in large quantities.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the Bank of England have decided to keep interest rates unchanged. This led to a slight drop in gold and silver prices, but silver has shown more resilience. The low open interest on Comex suggests that the downside for silver is limited. However, the strong dollar and rising bond yields pose a challenge for precious metals. The charts for 10-year bund and JGB yields indicate that they are likely to rise significantly. The global economy is contracting, and borrowers are facing difficulties due to higher interest rates. Hedge funds have traditionally believed that high interest rates are negative for gold, but there is a transition towards fear of the economic and monetary outlook for fiat currencies. The dollar has been strong recently due to these fears, but history has shown that in times of crisis, there is often an initial flight to the safety of the dollar. However, higher interest rates could ultimately crash the dollar, making gold an attractive investment.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the growing skepticism towards central banking policies and the Federal Reserve in the United States. The author argues that the public's awareness of how these policies work could be detrimental to the confidence Americans place in the Fed. They highlight the inflation and corporate bailouts that contribute to income inequality and criticize the lack of understanding among the general population. The author also credits Bitcoin for empowering the younger generation with knowledge about central banking and fiat currency. They express concern about the current state of monetary policy, including the massive liquidity injection due to COVID-19 stimulus, rapidly rising interest rates, and an overvalued stock market. The article mentions recent public questioning of central banking policies by politicians and the sale of gold bars by Costco, which reflects a lack of trust in the government's fiscal and monetary policies. The author suggests that these developments indicate a growing skepticism and potential volatility in the future.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the author's decision to start a podcast due to their dissatisfaction with mainstream financial media. The author criticizes CNBC for not giving enough attention to economic iconoclasts and Austrian thinkers. They specifically mention an incident where CNBC's "Fast Money" invited Bill Fleckenstein, a well-known advocate for the Austrian school, to discuss the macroeconomy. Instead of welcoming his contrarian viewpoint, one of the hosts labeled him "pathetic" and criticized his stance on gold and silver miners. The author provides three exhibits to support their claim that CNBC tends to celebrate bullish views without being skeptical or holding anyone accountable for missed calls. The article concludes by inviting readers to watch the video of the exchange between Fleckenstein and the host.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A recent search on PubMed using the search terms "COVID-19 vaccines" revealed over 6,000 peer-reviewed studies on vaccine hesitancy and how governments can overcome it. These studies focus on identifying vaccine-hesitant groups, statistics on these populations, and strategies to overcome hesitancy through propaganda, censorship, the law, and behavioral control. The government, WHO, and UNICEF have spent billions of dollars to manipulate beliefs and eliminate informed consent. The We Can Do This public education campaign, funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services, used a mix of digital, television, print, radio, and out-of-home channels to increase vaccine confidence and uptake. The campaign reached over 90% of US adults an average of 20.9 times and utilized propaganda and neuro-linguistic programming techniques. The campaign's success in increasing vaccine uptake has led to concerns about the government's use of propaganda and censorship in future crises, such as climate change or gun violence. The public's growing skepticism and distrust are seen as progress, but the administrative state is likely to increase its use of behavioral modification tools, propaganda, and censorship.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> University professors are grappling with the challenge of students using AI chatbots like ChatGPT to complete their assignments and essays. However, some professors, like Stephen Hicks from Rockford University, embrace this technology as a research tool that can enhance learning and skill development. The author argues that AI has the potential to disrupt critical thinking itself, which poses a new threat to a free society that relies on independent thinkers. On the one hand, AI may diminish critical thinking by becoming a crutch for students. On the other hand, it may also elevate critical thinking by providing new opportunities for analysis and understanding. The author suggests that in the future, human critical thinking may need to focus on questioning the biases of AI and its developers. Ultimately, the hope is that AI can be used as a tool for the betterment of society, promoting freedom and responsibility.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Chinese gold demand improved in August, with gold withdrawals from the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) totaling 161 tons, a 46-ton increase from the previous month. Despite a decline in the price of gold in dollar terms, it was up 1.8% in yuan due to Chinese currency weakness. Gold has outperformed most other assets in China, leading to strong wholesale and retail demand. Chinese investors are turning to gold as a safe-haven asset, with metal flowing into Chinese gold-backed ETFs for the third consecutive month. The People's Bank of China also added 29 tons of gold to its reserves in August, marking the 10th straight month of gold buying. However, high gold prices could pose challenges for the Chinese gold market. The World Gold Council predicts that an improved outlook for China's economy and upcoming jewelry fairs and industry events may support local gold demand.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> During World War II, Germany relied on synthetic fuels made from coal due to a lack of domestic oil supplies. However, the net energy produced from transforming coal into fuels was significantly lower than directly pumping and refining oil, giving the Allies a decisive advantage. The article criticizes the current trend of promoting synthetic fuels, known as eFuels, as a solution to eliminate fossil fuels. The eFuels concept involves using renewable energy sources, water, and CO2 from the air to produce fuels that are claimed to be climate-neutral. The aviation sector, in particular, is interested in eFuels to meet their net-zero emissions targets. However, the article questions the feasibility and efficiency of producing jet fuel from CO2. It argues that the focus should be on directly reducing carbon emissions rather than relying on synthetic fuels.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Mastercard's iconic "Priceless" campaign, launched in 1997, is still a part of the company's culture today. The campaign featured various commercials that went viral before viral was even a thing. One of the commercials involved NFL quarterback Brett Favre, who humorously critiques common mistakes made by average citizens. The brilliance of the ad lies in the fact that Favre, as an athlete constantly second-guessed for his on-the-field decisions, gets the opportunity to do some Monday morning quarterbacking of his own. The article also discusses the downsides of Twitter, particularly its relentless drive for engagement and the amplification of negativity. The author, who left Twitter to focus on Substack, reflects on the absence of noise in their daily life and the liberating effect it has had. They also mention their goal of averaging seven articles a month and reflect on their most engaging pieces of 2023.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the divide between different political camps in the developed West regarding climate change. On one extreme are the "hard right" or "climate deniers" who believe climate change is a hoax. On the other extreme are the "hard left" or "climate alarmists" who believe the world is in danger due to fossil fuels. In between these extremes are the "soft right" and "soft left" who have differing levels of concern for the climate crisis. The article highlights cracks appearing in the left-leaning alliance, with the UK Conservative Party leading a retreat from climate change targets. This retreat is driven by concerns about the cost and impact on standard of living. Similar retrenchments have been observed in Sweden and Canada, and there is a rightward tilt in German politics. The article suggests that the relentless assault on fossil fuels is causing economic hardship for lower and middle classes, and the crisis in the commodity markets for diesel and heating oil may accelerate the decline of climate alarmists' political power.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> During World War II, the struggle for oil played a significant role in shaping the strategies of the major parties involved. Germany, lacking domestic oil supplies, turned to synthetic fuels made from coal to sustain its war effort. However, the net energy produced from transforming coal into fuels was far inferior to the energy obtained from directly pumping and refining oil, ultimately contributing to Germany's defeat. Today, there is a resurgence of interest in synthetic fuels, known as eFuels, which involve using renewable energy sources, water, and CO2 from the air to produce climate-neutral fuels. The aviation sector, in particular, is enthusiastic about eFuels as a way to reduce carbon emissions and meet their net-zero targets. However, the feasibility and efficiency of producing jet fuel from CO2 remain questionable. The article highlights the importance of considering thermodynamics and the limitations of transforming energy sources when evaluating the potential of eFuels.</p>

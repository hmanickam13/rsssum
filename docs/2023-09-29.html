                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Anthony Albanese, the leader of the Australian Labor Party, is criticized for his response to a question about renewable energy in Parliament. Instead of expressing willingness to work with the Parliament, Albanese attacked the Greens for pressuring him to strengthen the Housing Fund. This response is seen as evidence that Albanese will not change his approach.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The author of the article responds to a dispute with Matt Yglesias regarding the polarization of American politics. The author argues that the Republican Party has become an extreme-right party, comparable to Fidesz in Hungary, while the Democratic Party is a moderate party of the center and center-left. The author criticizes an article by Yglesias titled "Polarization is a choice," stating that it promotes a false equivalence between the two parties. The author believes that the polarization is primarily driven by the far-right radicalization of the Republican Party, influenced by right-wing media and extremist voters. The author concludes that the analysis of the US political scene as a contest between two normal parties is fundamentally wrong and that the intention to establish a permanent right-wing dictatorship is evident.</p>

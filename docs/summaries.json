        "summary": "China's economic troubles, including a slowdown in growth, the techno-war with the West, and intellectual property theft, could have a significant impact on Japan's economy. Japan's exports to China, which make up a substantial portion of its GDP, have already declined, and a further decline could lead to a mild recession. The ongoing techno-war between China and the West, as well as corporate espionage, have also caused Japanese companies to slow down their investment in China. Japan's declining exports to China and its loss of market share in the country have been ongoing issues. Additionally, the tension between China and the West over technology has led to the cutting off of critical technologies to China, further impacting its economic growth potential. Japan, along with the US and Europe, has joined in restricting China's access to advanced technologies. The article highlights the vulnerability of Japan's economy to China's economic and political troubles and the need for Japan to diversify its supply chains and reduce its reliance on China."

        "published_date": "2023-10-18",

        "summary": "Ben Graham, known for his value investing approach, made more money with GEICO than all his other investments combined. This is because value investing focuses on buying cheap stocks with a margin of safety, even if they are not of the highest quality. Graham's approach allows for companies to turn around and improve their fundamentals over time. The recent CEO change at Unity, a gaming company, did not have a lasting positive impact on the stock due to the lost trust of game developers and studios. Stanley Druckenmiller, an investment icon, takes a bottom-up approach to investing, focusing on company-specific information rather than macroeconomic indicators. The article also mentions several cheap banks in emerging markets and the UK, such as Halyk Bank, Bancolombia, Postal Savings Bank of China, Lloyds Bank, and Banco de Brasil."

        "summary": "Diego B. Milano, Founder and Investment Manager of Quercus Fund, discusses his background and investment philosophy in an interview. Milano has been working in the financial markets for over 15 years and decided to focus on deep value, long-term, and concentrated investing. He launched Quercus Fund with a fee structure similar to Warren Buffett's partnerships in the 50s and 60s, with zero management fees and performance fees only above a certain threshold. Milano's ideal investment is an extremely undervalued business with a healthy balance sheet, poised for a significant increase in earnings and with a long runway for reinvestment. However, he acknowledges that clear investment cases are rarely extremely undervalued and there are usually issues that cloud the future and justify the undervaluation. The most important requirement for Milano is a large discrepancy between the price and conservatively appraised value of the investment."

        "summary": "John Holker, a skilled cloth manufacturer from Manchester in the early 18th century, was a Catholic and a Jacobite who joined Bonnie Prince Charlie's troops during the Jacobite uprising in 1745. After being captured and imprisoned, Holker escaped and eventually became an industrial spymaster for the French government. His main task was to steal British textile technologies, as Britain was already at the forefront of European technological development in many industries, including textiles, before the Industrial Revolution. Holker set up a network of agents in England and enticed skilled workers to come to France, where he ensured their skills were spread to French workers. The French government provided financial incentives and subsidies to promote the adoption of British techniques. Holker's efforts were successful, and he was promoted to Inspector-General of Manufactures. His son, John Holker Jr., followed in his footsteps as an industrial spy. Holker's career highlights his talent for espionage and his contribution to the transfer of technology between countries during this period."

The ISA stage involves the fundamental \"language\" that a semiconductor chip uses, with two dominant ISAs being Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) and Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC). Chip Design involves designing the chip itself, with companies like Apple, Google, and Intel playing a role in this stage. Fabrication is the manufacturing stage, with TSMC, Samsung, and Intel being the major players. Equipment & Software refers to the machines and technology used in the fabrication process, with ASML being the only company capable of producing the necessary equipment. Finally, Packaging & Testing involves packaging the chip and testing it for defects before it is shipped out. This subsector is highly fragmented. The article highlights the strategic importance of the semiconductor sector and how it has become a geopolitical chess piece."

Stock index futures are pointing to small gains, with small caps leading the way. Bonds are seeing renewed bids at the short end of the curve, resulting in the yield curve uninverting. Commodities are mostly unchanged. PepsiCo reported earnings that beat estimates and raised guidance, causing the stock to move higher in pre-market trading. Several Fed speakers are scheduled for today, with expectations that they will align with the previous commentary. However, there is a possibility that some speakers, such as Bostic and Kashkari, may deviate from the consensus. It is surprising how quickly investors have moved on from geopolitical concerns, possibly treating the Middle East conflict as just another regional conflict."

The author highlights the parallels in terms of the exponential growth in demand and the belief in scaling to larger networks or neural networks. They also note the high capital intensity of both industries. However, the author emphasizes that there are significant differences, such as the lower leverage in the AI industry compared to the telecom bubble, the lower barrier to entry in AI, and the current rate hike cycle that has prevented excessive speculation. The author also discusses the importance of supply reacting to demand and how supply in the AI industry is likely to eventually overshoot demand. Overall, the article provides insights into the potential risks and dynamics of the current AI and infrastructure boom."

        "summary": "Momentum is building towards the development of a nasal COVID-19 vaccine, with promising results from early clinical trials and new funding awards. The rationale for a nasal vaccine is based on the need for population-wide respiratory mucosal immunity to combat the evolving virus and its variants. Experimental studies have shown that nasal vaccines can provide tissue-level mucosal immunity, which is lacking in intramuscular vaccines. Nasal vaccines have been found to induce strong mucosal immunity, lower viral loads, and reduce disease and fatality. They also have the potential to provide variant-proof protection. Two companies, Castlevax and Codagenix, have recently announced the results of their Phase 1 human trials for nasal vaccines and have received funding from the US government to accelerate clinical development. Additionally, researchers at Ohio State University have developed a triple intranasal vaccine against measles, mumps, and COVID-19, which has shown a potent immune response in animal models. While there is still a need for further clinical trials, the development of a safe and effective nasal vaccine could provide durable protection against COVID-19 and help in the fight against the ongoing pandemic."

Shareholders want to maximize the valuation of shares, but this carries risks in the long run. Opening for trading below the offering price can be embarrassing and demoralizing. To navigate this, current owners should disclose as much as possible about the business without compromising its competitive position. Warren Buffett's approach to issuing Class B shares in 1996 serves as an example. The players involved in the IPO process have different perspectives based on their incentives. Owners participating in the offering want top dollar, while those planning to exit soon also prefer a high valuation. Owners planning to hold their interest indefinitely want a price that compensates for dilution. The composition of the board of directors determines the dominant owner constituency. Short-term oriented owners may use aggressive accounting methods and non-GAAP metrics to present the business in the best light. Long-term oriented owners prefer candid disclosures. Executive management should have significant stock ownership and stock-based compensation with a multi-year vesting period."

Dollar General also provided updated guidance for its fiscal year, with same-store sales expected to decline by 1% to 0% and diluted earnings per share expected to range from $7.10 to $7.60. The firing of Owen suggests that the board believes the company's problems are company-specific rather than macroeconomic.

While later stage deals have declined, there is a growing interest in pre-seed investments, with larger VC firms in the region starting to invest in the bottom of the value chain. The global economic slowdown and the difficulty of landing big investments have pushed fund managers to flock to early-stage deals. Pre-seed investments offer the opportunity for accelerators and angels to pick up stakes in promising startups at low valuations. The failure rate is high for these early investments, but fund managers only need one or two successful startups to generate significant returns. The emergence of more early-stage funding and mentorship resources, managed by senior operators and founders, may change the way accelerators and incubation programs operate in the region. Overall, the increase in early-stage capital is positive for Southeast Asia's startup ecosystem during the current funding winter."

        "summary": "The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has called for more attention and assistance for Myanmar's Rohingya refugees. The agency has only secured 42% of the annual budget needed to provide safe housing for the refugees. The lack of humanitarian assistance is causing conditions to regress and making it difficult to renew shelters. The UNHCR is urging the international community to make big pledges in support of the Rohingya refugees and to provide open policies for host countries. Meanwhile, three signatories have ditched an event hosted by the military in Myanmar, marking the eight-year anniversary of a cease-fire between armed ethnic groups and the military. Junta leader Min Aung Hlaing has not been invited to the Belt and Road Initiative Forum in Beijing, which is seen as a blow to the regime's legitimacy abroad."

The big three ratings agencies have not made any announcements yet, but they are expected to monitor the situation before reacting. In another article, despite the biggest bond losses ever, the financial system remains robust. Bond investors have faced challenges due to central banks hiking rates, which has led to unrealized losses.

The white paper highlights the need for cooperation, openness, and inclusiveness in global development. It also criticizes certain countries for practicing unilateralism, protectionism, and hegemonism, which threaten economic globalization.

Skilling and other executives at Enron artificially inflated revenues and hid losses through accounting and corporate fraud. Skilling sold millions of shares before the company's collapse, pocketing millions of dollars. Insider trading by company executives is not uncommon, accounting for 4% of the SEC's actions in 2021. Recent examples include the CEO of Silicon Valley Bank selling shares before the bank collapsed and the Pfizer CEO selling stock on the day the company announced success in clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine. Studies suggest that corporate insiders exploit their access to non-public information for unfair market advantage, and the profits generated from insider trading are statistically significant. Detecting illegal insider trading is challenging, but researchers have developed methods to identify potential trading on non-public information. The SEC requires company insiders to report changes in their holdings, and this data is publicly available. Researchers have used time stamps from audit letters to identify if insiders traded on non-public information.

However, the bans were not a surprise and BAT is challenging them in court, with a good chance of receiving a stay on their implementation. Previous FDA bans have been overturned, and even if the bans were to take effect, Vuse has demonstrated 100% volume retention in a similar ban in California. The key risk remains the FDA's plan to ban menthol cigarettes, which account for 60% of BAT's US cigarette sales. However, previous menthol bans have shown volume retention of 65%+ in the same category and up to 110% including other categories. BAT's low valuation and leadership in vapor products make it a good investment, and the risk from Philip Morris' IQOS menthol products is limited as they are not expected to have a meaningful impact until after 2025. Overall, BAT's shares have a 6.5x P/E and a 14.7% Free Cash Flow Yield, making them an attractive investment."

        "summary": "Bank of America (BAC) released its Q3 2023 results, reporting stable earnings with a Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) of 15.5%. Deposits, Net Interest Margin, and Net Interest Income (NII) were all relatively flat. While NII is expected to decline modestly, management anticipates it will resume growing in Q3 2024. Investment Banking fees remain below pre-COVID levels, but Sales & Trading revenues have increased. Non-Interest Expenses have continued to decrease, and credit costs for the year are comparable to pre-COVID levels. BAC is already over-capitalized, so the impact of Basel III Endgame rules, which will raise equity capital requirements by 20%, will be less significant. With a Price/Tangible Book Value of 1.15x, BAC shares have a normalized P/E of 8.5x. The dividend yield is 3.5%, and forecasts indicate a total return of 91% by the end of 2026. The investment case for BAC is based on its ability to maintain a low-teens long-term ROTCE on a growing capital base."

The man showed her a badge and tried to get her to go with him, but she asked to verify his identity and he disappeared. Later, it was discovered that he had been tracking her for years and had stolen jewelry from her house. He had also made a shopping list that included items like a garrote and a knife, indicating his intention to harm her. The police found personal information of other sex workers in his possession. The woman believes that his motive was her profession as a sex worker. She initially hesitated to report the incident to the police due to fear of arrest."

        "summary": "The Weekly S&P500 #ChartStorm highlights several key observations. First, there is a potential \"bull flag\" pattern forming, indicating a possible uptrend continuation. However, this pattern needs confirmation. Second, sentiment is becoming bearish, which is interesting considering the upcoming seasonal upshift in flows. Third, stocks appear stretched compared to bonds in terms of price and value. Fourth, equity market valuations are behaving unusually, raising questions about whether this time is different. Fifth, gold miners are cheaper than energy stocks. Overall, there are important \"lines in the sand\" forming for markets, with bullish evidence for the short-term outlook, but risks are also building up. Additionally, the Consensus Inc sentiment indicator dropping below 50% suggests that historically, this has favored the bulls. The seasonal pattern of fund flows indicates that November is typically a strong month. Defensive stocks have been hit hard, potentially signaling a contrarian opportunity. Stocks have had a remarkable run compared to corporate bonds since 2009, but they are now overbought at resistance. Stocks are also expensive compared to bonds and history, while bonds are relatively cheap. Lastly, microcap returns are experiencing drawdowns similar to 2020 levels, except for big tech."

        "summary": "The recent drawdown in US treasuries is the worst in recorded history, comparable to the drawdowns in Bitcoin. Investment-grade corporate bonds have also seen significant drawdowns due to rising interest rates. However, fund managers and strategists expect longer-term bond yields to be lower next year. The ZEW survey respondents and a majority of fund managers surveyed believe that bond yields will be lower in the future. The correlation between the copper vs gold ratio and US 10-year bond yields seems to be suffering due to the pandemic's supply and stimulus shocks. Another infirm correlation is between US 10-year yields and developed market manufacturing PMIs. The search for yield theme has reversed, with cash providing greater yield than traditional yield-oriented assets. The question arises whether higher interest rates can be the cure for higher interest rates, considering the impact on valuations in real estate and equity markets."

        "summary": "The cost of capital is increasing as baby boomers retire and invest in more conservative assets, leading to markdowns in the private tech market. Startup costs have significantly decreased due to SaaS tools, cloud services, and new distribution platforms, allowing founders to build products with as little as $50-100k. This shift in startup costs has implications for the VC industry, with a move towards bootstrapping and profitability becoming more popular. The VC industry is expected to become more barbell-shaped, with big funds on one end and small, specialized funds on the other. The middle ground will struggle to survive. The restructuring of the VC industry will also lead to a consolidation into three distinct segments: traditional artisanal approach, specialization in B2B SaaS startups, and a shift towards private equity-like investments. Small funds are expected to thrive in this new landscape. The dilution of seed investors' returns in later funding rounds highlights the importance of building a profitable business early on. Overall, this is an exciting time for startups and venture capital as a new Renaissance emerges in Silicon Valley."

        "summary": "US real rates have reached their highest level in 15 years, and understanding why is crucial for those following the economy and capital markets. Real rates are the yield paid on government bonds after inflation is deducted. Currently, the US is experiencing both strong economic growth and a high government budget deficit, leading to an increase in Treasury bond issuance. The main drivers of real rates are economic growth, which is influenced by an expanding labor force and improving productivity. Demographics pose a headwind for real growth, as the long-term trend is down, but there is still a large reservoir of employable people outside the labor force. Productivity is typically low during inflationary periods, but the potential impact of AI could provide a boost from 2025 onwards. The high levels of private sector debt following the Great Financial Crisis drove real rates below zero, but currently, large parts of the US economy have no leverage issue. Overall, the current economic context suggests that real rates are too high, and a significant downside move in equities may be on the horizon."

Haghani found that players often over-bet, under-bet, and bet on tails, indicating a lack of understanding of position sizing. Position sizing is critical in portfolio management, as correctly sizing picks is more important than identifying good investments. Haghani's experiment highlights the importance of understanding risk and position sizing in finance and gambling. Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of crypto exchange FTX, also had a skewed risk perception, as he believed in going big even if it meant a high chance of going bust. However, this approach is not sustainable in the long run. Bankman-Fried's miscalibrated risk engine led him astray, and his risk preferences made it likely that he would go bust quickly.

The bank has hired Jones Lang LaSalle to sell the loan at a discount, offering investors an opportunity for capital appreciation. The building's occupancy has dropped to 58% due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and attempts to attract tenants with discounted rents have been unsuccessful. Repurposing the building for residential use would lower its value significantly. Aareal Bank, with its experience in the real estate industry, has increased its loan loss provisions to absorb the financial hit from 61 Broadway.

Additionally, the 30-year long bond issue has suffered a significant decrease in value. As a result, the risk/reward ratio for shorting bonds is no longer favorable."

The COVID-19 pandemic initially benefited the company as people stocked up on essential items and purchased furniture while in quarantine. However, the company's financial situation has worsened, with declining sales, increased SG&A expenses, and decreasing gross margins due to higher freight costs and inflationary pressures. Despite efforts to improve its balance sheet in FY'20, the company's total debt has skyrocketed to $504.4 million by the end of 2Q'23. To address its liquidity issues, Big Lots has engaged in sale-leaseback transactions, with the latest involving its distribution center in California and 22 store locations, generating net proceeds of approximately $294 million. The company plans to use the proceeds to pay off its debt. However, with limited remaining owned stores and distribution centers, the company may need to explore other options, such as operational improvements or equity dilution, to secure liquidity."

CSC Generation Holdings, which already owns the DirectBuy business, acquired Z Gallerie out of bankruptcy in 2019 and will provide a $2.2 million debtor-in-possession credit facility to fund the sale process. General unsecured creditors are unlikely to receive any funds due to the extent of the pre-petition secured debt. The first day hearing for the bankruptcy case is scheduled for later today."

Scavengers Reign defies preconceived ideas about American adult animation and draws influences from works like Nausica\u00e4 and Akira. The series features a unique animation style and focuses more on character drama than fight choreography. Despite the challenges of getting the show made, the creators were able to make exactly what they wanted with the support of their partners. Scavengers Reign is set to premiere on October 19. In other animation news, a Russian film called Fairytale, an experimental collage work by Alexander Sokurov, has been denied a distribution certificate in Russia, highlighting the increasing censorship and suppression of art in the country."

The company has also experienced high executive turnover and has a Compliance Committee with concerning oversight. The Better Business Bureau has given LifeStance an F rating and issued an alert about complaints regarding billing issues. State regulators have also received complaints, with one consumer alleging that the company has been involved in fraud and regularly signs patients up for unwanted appointments to boost fee revenue. A former LifeStance employee raised similar concerns about erroneous billing and scheduling visits that were not made. Some customers have been charged cancellation fees for appointments that LifeStance cancels. The allegations raise questions about whether LifeStance is a legitimate therapy franchise or an illegal billing operation."

        "summary": "Private equity firm Blackstone has seen continued growth in assets under management (AUM), leading some to consider it a good investment. However, the theory that rising interest rates would negatively impact private equity seems to be playing out, as publicly reported commitments to private equity have fallen significantly. Despite this, Blackstone recently closed a $30 billion fund, suggesting a lag in money flows. It is important to note that there is a difference between total AUM and fee-earning AUM, with real estate being a significant portion of the latter. Blackstone has been aggressively pursuing the acquisition of listed real estate investment trusts (REITs) and making them private, allowing them to charge performance fees. However, the performance of listed apartment REITs and slowing flows to the private equity sector may put financial pressure on Blackstone's permanent capital structures. Despite rising interest rates, the stability of collateral values, such as rising US house prices, has helped support Blackstone's AUM. However, a short position on Blackstone may be advisable if inflation and interest rates continue to rise or collateral values start to fall."

This leads to a bullish outlook on wages and real assets, and a bearish outlook on financial assets. The author suggests going long on gold (GLD) and short on long-dated treasuries (TLT) as a way to express this view. The author also suggests going long on high-yield bonds (HYG) and short on TLT for those who don't like the negative carry of the GLD/TLT idea. In a pro-labour world, regulations and tariffs are necessary to protect domestic wages, making devaluing the currency unnecessary. This means that foreigners are no longer the main buyers of treasuries, and locals are buying them instead. The author notes that the S&P 500 has held up well against gold, but a short portfolio of bond proxies and businesses that don't work at interest rates above 7% could be profitable."

Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted from his position after a motion to remove him was brought by a conservative member and every Democrat voted against him. McCarthy's removal came after House conservatives feared he had cut a side deal with President Biden on Ukraine funding. The war in Ukraine is not going well, and conservative opposition to sending more military assistance is growing. This poses a challenge for the Biden administration as it heads into an election year. The situation in the Middle East, with the assault by Hamas on Israel, further complicates matters. Funding for Ukraine is running dry, and the pressure on the situation is increasing. The Biden administration is considering linking Ukraine funding to aid for Israel in an attempt to increase the chances of Congress approving aid to Kyiv. However, the situation remains fluid, and much depends on how quickly Republicans can settle on a new speaker and how strongly conservatives oppose Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russian President Putin has blamed the US for the violence in Israel and warned of conflict expansion. In the midst of these events, a natural gas pipeline connecting Finland to Estonia has been severely damaged, possibly due to sabotage. The situation raises questions about Putin's intentions and the potential for further escalation."

However, a closer look reveals that Uruguay still relies on fossil fuels during periods of drought and that hydroelectric dams play a significant role in its renewable energy mix. The country's small population and relatively low GDP per capita also make its situation less applicable to larger, wealthier nations. Additionally, Uruguay's high consumption of beef contributes significantly to its carbon footprint. The article argues that Uruguay's experience highlights the limitations and challenges of achieving a fully renewable electricity grid, including the need for backup power and the environmental impact of large-scale dams.

Despite its reputation, the Walled City had a surprisingly low crime rate and a strong sense of community. The demolition of the Walled City was met with mixed reactions, with some residents mourning the loss of their homes and others relieved to escape the squalor. Today, the site of the Walled City has been transformed into a park, but its legacy lives on as a symbol of urban chaos and resilience."

He finds delight and fascination in the stories of Paradise Lost, Plutarch's Lives, and The Sorrows of Werter. These books introduce him to new ideas and emotions, and he relates to the characters and their experiences. However, the creature also becomes increasingly aware of his own isolation and monstrous appearance. He longs for companionship and hopes that the cottagers he observes will accept and understand him. Eventually, he decides to reveal himself to the blind old man in the cottage, hoping to gain his sympathy and support. However, when the old man's family discovers the creature, they react with horror and violence. The creature is devastated and flees back to his hovel, feeling rejected and alone once again."

        "published_date": "2023-10-18",

        "summary": "Global debt has reached a record high of $397 trillion in the first half of 2023, according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF). This increase in debt comes despite tightening credit conditions and is a cause for concern as artificially low interest rates are no longer sustainable. Developed nations, including Japan, the US, Britain, and France, accounted for about 80% of the new global debt, while emerging markets such as China, Brazil, and India also saw significant increases. The IIF warns that as interest rates rise and debt levels increase, domestic debt strains will also rise. The US government alone is over $33 trillion in debt, and interest payments on the debt now match national defense spending. The global economy, which has relied on easy money and low interest rates, is now facing the challenge of higher rates that could potentially break the borrow-and-spend economy. The CPI may show a cooling of inflation, but rising prices are still a concern for Americans. Peter Schiff, an economist, argues that the government is not being honest about inflation, and people are struggling with higher costs of living. To protect themselves, Schiff suggests investing in assets such as gold and silver and divesting from the US dollar."

        "summary": "President Joe Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have claimed that the United States can afford to fund wars in both Israel and Ukraine. However, this claim is not true, as it fails to consider the military goals and the potential costs of these conflicts. In the case of Israel, the goal is not just to prevent Hamas attacks, but to overwhelmingly defeat the movement and kill or capture its leadership. This could be a costly and difficult task, as Hamas has hidden resources and uses an unmapped tunnel system. Similarly, Ukraine's goal is to drive Russian forces out of occupied territories, but the campaign has resulted in heavy casualties and equipment losses without significant territorial gains. Funding these wars would place a heavy financial burden on the American people, who are already facing economic challenges such as dwindling savings, high inflation, and record-high debt. The current monetary system may create the illusion that the government can solve global problems without raising taxes, but in reality, the cost is borne by the public through inflation."

The Fed believes that they are close to the peak of the tightening cycle and rising long-term interest rates will help in managing inflation.

The article highlights the historical context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with Israel ruling over a large Palestinian population in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and within Israel itself. The US had been focused on building Israel's diplomatic bridges and diverting attention away from the Palestinian cause, but Hamas' actions have brought the issue back to the forefront. The article argues that blaming Iranian support for Hamas misses the point of the deep-rooted Palestinian grievances. China's failure to criticize Hamas has shocked the West, but other parts of the world may have a better understanding of the conflict's history. The renewed US focus on the Middle East could divert attention and resources from other global issues. Ultimately, the article questions whether Israel can sustain its control over a large Palestinian population in the long term."

The conflict is the deadliest and most sophisticated since the Yom Kippur War 50 years ago and is shaking the entire Middle East. It is also impacting the Biden administration's plans to counter Chinese and Russian influence in the region. The US has been a key supporter of Israel, providing annual aid of $3.3 billion, making it the largest recipient of US aid since World War II. However, this aid is now causing condemnation of both Washington and Jerusalem in Middle Eastern capitals. The recent diplomatic forays of China and Russia into the region, particularly their success in normalizing Iran-Saudi and Saudi-Syria ties, have prompted the US to seek normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel through the Abraham Accords. However, the Saudis have been difficult to bargain with, and the conflict between Hamas and Israel has further complicated the situation. The conflict is also benefiting Iran, as it pushes Saudi Arabia away from normalization. If the war continues and results in heavy casualties among Palestinians, it will shelve the Saudi-Israel deal and affect Washington's plans to reshape the Middle East."

The relationship between President Widodo and his party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP), is unclear following his support for Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto, who ran against Widodo in previous elections. The court's decision has been criticized for favoring Gibran and is seen as an indication of political interests influencing election regulations. With the approaching registration period for the general election, tensions are rising, and there are reports of a breakdown in relations between Widodo and the PDIP. Analysts believe that Widodo's support for Prabowo is aimed at securing his political future and protecting his legacy. If rumors of Gibran accompanying Prabowo come true, the PDIP is expected to double its efforts to defeat them in the election."

China has made crucial modifications to the BRI, shifting its focus towards services and the digital world. This includes an emphasis on e-commerce, investment protection treaties, standardized trade rules, and green development. The rebranding of the BRI aims to address Western criticism and present China as a responsible economic player. China's openness to foreign investment and removal of restrictions further positions it as an attractive partner for global corporations and governments. In contrast, Washington-supported plans like the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) pale in comparison to the renewed BRI. Ongoing conflicts and Washington's uncritical support for Israel may also impact the viability of these plans. China's revival of the BRI comes at an opportune time for Beijing, while posing challenges for Washington."

        "summary": "China is expected to tighten its funding for Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects in the coming years, despite President Xi Jinping's promise to maintain funding at the recent Belt and Road Forum. Analysts predict that China will focus on quality over quantity and prioritize projects that are economically viable and have a positive impact on local communities. This shift in approach is driven by concerns over debt sustainability and the need to address criticism of the BRI's environmental and social impact. China is also likely to increase its scrutiny of potential borrowers and prioritize countries with stable political environments and strong governance. The tightening of funding is expected to affect countries that have already received significant BRI investments, as well as those seeking future funding. However, China will continue to support projects that align with its strategic interests, such as infrastructure development and connectivity initiatives."

Unlike the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, Novavax's vaccine contains a coronavirus protein that stimulates the immune system. The company has found a way to produce the vaccine using moth cells, allowing for faster manufacturing. The Novavax vaccine has been shown to provide 50% protection against symptomatic disease in fully vaccinated individuals, according to an Italian study. It is available for anyone 12 years and older, including those who have previously received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. Distribution of the vaccine will take time, but it will eventually be available at 13,000 stores. There is some evidence that mixing the Novavax vaccine with an mRNA vaccine may be immunologically better, but more research is needed. Novavax has also been found to have fewer side effects compared to mRNA vaccines."

COVID-19 metrics, including wastewater, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations, are declining, following the usual seasonal trend. Hospitalizations for COVID-19 are lower than in previous years due to population-level immunity. The Omicron variant is expected to drive the winter surge, with the BA.2.86 variant showing a growth advantage and FLiP mutations gaining ground. Influenza levels are very low, with one strain, Yamagata influenza B, going extinct due to COVID-19 measures. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is picking up, particularly in the South, signaling the start of the RSV season. Excess mortality is above pre-pandemic levels. Vaccination rates for COVID-19 and flu are still uncertain, with 2% of the eligible population estimated to have received their fall COVID-19 vaccine. It is recommended to get vaccinated before Halloween and to wear masks when ILI levels reach epidemic levels."

        "summary": "Vicarious trauma, the psychological impact of second-hand exposure to traumatic events, can have long-lasting effects on mental health. The extent of suffering depends on the dose of exposure and socio-demographic factors. Media exposure, especially through social media and television, can worsen the impact of traumatic events. Studies have shown that heavy social media use after such events can lead to an excess mental health service burden. Certain socio-demographic groups, such as those who share a social identity with the victims or have experienced pre-event trauma, are at higher risk of experiencing vicarious trauma. To reduce the impact of vicarious trauma, individuals can turn off auto-play videos on social media, take breaks from social media, pay attention to their emotions, seek social support, talk to someone they trust, find ways to feel useful, and monitor children's exposure to media. It is important to recognize the collective trauma caused by witnessing terrorist attacks and war and to seek support when feeling overwhelmed."

        "summary": "The article discusses the role of unions in the US and argues that while they have historically played an important role in improving working conditions and protecting workers' rights, they have now become a hindrance to industries and the economy as a whole. The author argues that unions have evolved into a cancer that is slowly killing the industries they are trying to save. The article highlights the negative impact of unions on industries such as ports and automakers, where union demands for higher wages and benefits, as well as restrictions on automation, have made these industries less competitive and less efficient. The author also criticizes the difficulty of firing union members and the toxic workplace culture that unions can create. The article concludes by advocating for a more free-market approach to labor relations, where companies can compete for talent and workers have the freedom to choose their employers."

The fund aims to provide financial aid to dads who need therapy but may not be able to afford it. The initiative was inspired by the founder's own experience with mental health after becoming a father. The fund operates by taking a portion of the newsletter's proceeds and directly giving it to dads in need. However, the process has faced challenges, including difficulties in raising awareness and reaching out to dads who require support. Additionally, the complexity of the US medical system has posed obstacles in finding therapists who can work with US-based clients. Despite these challenges, the therapy fund has already raised a significant amount of money and has helped more dads this year compared to the previous year. The New Fatherhood encourages readers to contribute to the fund by becoming paid subscribers, with their subscription fees going towards helping dads in need."

        "summary": "Real estate is a popular outlet for savings, but there is skepticism about whether the stock market can replace it due to its complexity and unfamiliarity. However, there is a need to find an alternative to real estate, as it accounts for a significant portion of annual economic activity. Constraints such as affordability and leverage prevent real estate from becoming too hot, as it could lead to a major economic and social crisis. In China, the real estate market has become the center of the economy, with local governments benefiting from land sales and families investing in apartments. However, the reliance on real estate has led to a conundrum, as stopping the process of rising prices would cause tremendous pain throughout the economy. The resolution of this issue is expected to be time-consuming and uncertain. Distressed-debt investors who bought bonds from Evergrande, a Chinese real estate company, are realizing that the restructuring process will be overseen by the government and depend on its future plans for the firm."

        "summary": "China's October Golden Week, a major holiday period, saw impressive travel statistics, including 826 million domestic trips and 14.22 million air passengers. However, the travel economy is still recovering, and the future of China's outbound travel remains uncertain. Chinese brands have excelled at marketing to Chinese consumers, operating at a speed that is hard to match. Chinese social media plays a significant role in driving the quest for new travel experiences, with user-generated content trusted more than brand-created content. China's high-speed rail network has become pivotal in trip planning and destination marketing, attracting younger travelers and offering appealing onboard services. China also has a unique take on over-tourism, with some destinations becoming overrun during Golden Week. South East Asian destinations, which heavily rely on Chinese tourists, have had to manage their expectations due to decreased international air capacity and gradual demand. It is important for destinations and travel suppliers to avoid over-emphasizing the three Golden Weeks and instead focus on year-round opportunities."

Deep Sail focuses on microcaps, special situations, and quality growth on the long side, and potential frauds, pump and dumps, and fads on the short side. Westropp explains that the \"right ponds\" for the fund are industries with high returns on capital invested, stable growth trajectories, high barriers to entry, and little commodity exposure. He also outlines the four pillars of an exceptional investment that the fund uses to evaluate potential investments. In terms of managing the short book, Westropp emphasizes the importance of valuation and sets criteria for short positions, such as avoiding companies with a short-borrow rate above 30%. He also highlights IPO hangovers, industry bubbles, pump and dumps, and growth deceleration as areas to look for short opportunities. Westropp concludes by discussing how Deep Sail Capital finds off-the-beaten-path ideas through a mix of screeners, investor networks, Twitter, and thematic-driven ideas.

The company has a long history, starting in 1758, and has gone through various changes and acquisitions over the years.

The spirits segment has solid pricing power and good returns on capital. The non-alcoholic segment represents a smaller portion of revenue, with the Mio Mio brand being the growth driver. Mio Mio is a mate soft drink that is growing rapidly. The company has reduced its low-margin contract bottling business and is focusing on its owned brands and private labels. Berentzen also has a segment for fresh fruit machines, which has been stable but not impressive in terms of growth. The company also has other smaller segments, such as a museum experience and sales to the tourism industry in Turkey. Overall, Berentzen Group's strategy, management, market position, valuation, and capital allocation are factors to consider when evaluating the company."

This has created opportunities for investors to make uncorrelated returns by betting on the outcome of these cases. The author believes that the market has been slow to recognize this change and continues to price these cases as coin flips, presenting ongoing investment opportunities. They mention several potential opportunities, including Seagen, Albertson, iRobot, and Spirit Airlines, and emphasize the need for careful analysis of each individual case and the broader regulatory landscape.

The largest competitor, Kopenhagen Fur, is set to liquidate in 2025, potentially allowing Saga Furs to gain market share. Saga Furs generates revenue through commissions charged to farmers and buyers at their auctions, as well as interest income from delayed payments. The company has historically struggled with negative earnings due to low fur prices and fixed costs, but higher sales could unlock operating leverage. The correlation between fur prices and Saga Furs' profit suggests that prices may rise in 2024. The author predicts that Saga Furs could take a significant portion of Kopenhagen Fur's market share and potentially achieve a monopolistic position. The company's clean balance sheet, with ample cash and little debt, and its asset-light business model further support its investment potential. While future earnings and price targets are uncertain, the author believes that buying Saga Furs at a low valuation presents a low-risk opportunity for potential profit."

The company's founders, Michael Kirban and Ira Liran, recognized the untapped potential of the coconut water market in the US in 2003 and established a strong supply chain by partnering with coconut product manufacturers in various countries. Despite facing competition from industry giants like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, Vita Coco has emerged as the category leader in the US, with approximately 50% market share. The company has also expanded its focus to serve private label demand, particularly from Costco, which accounts for about 30% of its sales. However, Vita Coco recently announced the transition of its supply relationship with its largest private label customer, which is believed to be Costco. This development raises concerns about the long-term differentiation of Vita Coco's brand from private label offerings. The financial implications of this transition have not been quantified, but it is estimated to be around $50 million per year. Despite this setback, Vita Coco remains a dominant player in the coconut water market, which has grown to nearly $700 million in annual retail sales in the US."

A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that a 10% increase in natural gas prices can lead to a 0.2% increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

The recent strength in gold was due to US regional bank failures and speculation of a higher China premium to global prices. However, even a partial catch-up with real yields could lead to a decline in precious metals. Silver, in particular, is at risk of a sharp decline as it no longer has a high correlation to gold and has industrial uses. The article suggests that if the gold triangle pattern break is verified, there could be meaningful declines in precious metals. The base case price target for gold is $1,700. For silver, if the bear flag thesis is correct, prices should break below $22.15 and gain momentum, with a price target of $15.25. The article also mentions that gold volatility has recently moved sharply and may need a pause before heading higher. Overall, the divergence between gold and real yields suggests that gold may need to catch up in the future."

        "summary": "The Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board have kept their interest rates unchanged, but the reactions in the bond market have been different. The UK Gilt yield curve has bull steepened, while the US yield curve has bear steepened. The British pound has weakened against the Euro and US Dollar, indicating that market participants are unwinding their positions in rates and currencies. Short positions against Gilts were likely curve trades against European bonds. The market suggests a sharp UK slowdown in the short term as the likely outcome. The US Friday reversal may well create a softening in yield in the short term, but it is likely a pause for yet higher yields. Two out of three key US equity indices confirm an H&S pattern. The Russell 2000 and S&P 500 have broken their H&S patterns, while the Nasdaq 100 is at crucial support. The UK Gilt yields are close to breaking down, especially in the curve's 2- and 5-year parts. The oversold momentum indicators are the only things going for the British Pound (GBP), which is insufficient to call for a sustainable bounce. The sharp move in yields last week should be seen in a near one-year consolidation pattern in 10- and 30-year yields. A bond bid due to an equity selloff is unlikely if the decline is measured and not unruly. A 35-year bond bull market unwinds will never be sideways, nor will it end when most think it has fallen too far and cannot fall much further."

Other issues discussed included the impact of climate change, declining fertility rates, the return of the big state, and financial repression. Chartres concluded that the biggest risk for investors is inflation and financial repression, and recommended being more active, owning real assets, and being anti-fragile to preserve wealth. Ruffer also shared a list of \"lobster pot\" stocks that are easy to get into but hard to get out of, with China being a major factor in many of them."

The author highlights the disturbing behavior and rhetoric displayed by some leftists, including celebrating the targeting of civilians and making anti-Semitic remarks. The article also points out the lack of moral consistency among these leftists, as they support Hamas' actions but refuse to support Ukraine's defense against Russian occupation. The author suggests that the Western leftist movement has fallen to a deep sickness and that their support for the Palestinian cause is driven by opposition to the West rather than genuine concern for human rights. The article concludes by stating that this episode will likely damage the leftist movement's reputation among progressive Americans."

        "summary": "Claudia Goldin has been awarded the 2023 Nobel Prize in Economics for her work on women's labor market outcomes. Goldin is recognized as one of the pioneers of the \"credibility revolution\" in empirical economics, which focuses on using natural experiments to test hypotheses. Her research has shown the impact of technological innovations, such as the birth control pill, on women's careers and marriage decisions. Goldin's methodology is broad and eclectic, incorporating theories, cultural norms, politics, and economic history. She has created new data sets and uncovered trends in women's employment, highlighting the complex factors that influence women's economic situation. While progress has been made in reducing gender inequalities, Goldin's research also shows that women still face a tradeoff between child-rearing and careers. She suggests that remote work could be a solution to advancing gender equality by providing more flexibility in the workplace. Goldin's work demonstrates the power of understanding social problems at their functional level and using knowledge to reshape the world."

Techno-optimism can also be active or passive, with active optimism believing that technology will progress and improve human life only if the appropriate actions are taken. The author subscribes to both positive and normative techno-optimism but leans more towards active optimism. They believe that technology expands society's collective set of choices and that humans should be given as much choice as possible. However, they acknowledge that society's choices may not always align with individual choices and that technology can be used for both good and evil. The author also argues that sustaining technological progress requires a whole-of-society approach and the collaboration of various institutions. They emphasize the importance of society using technology responsibly and for the greater good. Finally, the author believes that sustainability is not an enemy of techno-optimism but rather a core part of it, as innovation is necessary to sustain technological society into the future."

It explains how state ownership of property in planned economies leads to resource-constrained shortages, while private ownership in market economies leads to demand-constrained surpluses. The article then discusses the recent reemergence of acute shortages in the global economy, caused by overwhelming demand and supply-side constraints. It highlights the role of monetary policy in addressing these shortages and the need for a balance between tightening policy to harden firms' budget constraints and hoping for supply-side capacity to return. The article also discusses the easing of supply constraints in various sectors, such as advanced manufacturing, energy, and food production, leading to increased output and stabilization of prices. It emphasizes that the stabilization in prices has primarily come from improvements in supply rather than contractions in demand. The article concludes by noting the importance of hardening global budget constraints to end the shortage economy and the need for central banks to prevent runaway price increases."

The article also mentions the existence of unique canine-specific short interspersed elements (SINEs) in dog DNA, which can turn gene functions off and on or amplify/dampen gene expression. The author reflects on their recently passed dog, Fiona, and the special bond between humans and dogs.

However, despite export controls and financial sanctions, Russia has been able to import what it needs for its military from the same countries that are supporting Ukraine. Russia's imports of manufactured goods have rebounded and remained steady, with exports from the EU and other democracies being routed through third countries. The Russian government initially restricted the data it published on imports, but has now resumed publishing monthly data. This is a serious problem as many exports going to Russia are coming from the allied democracies, including sophisticated machine tools necessary for military equipment. Extreme sanctions on Russian oil and gas exports have also proven ineffective, as the Russian government does not pay for anything using oil and gas, but rather relies on the ability to tap into the resources of productive societies through imports. Limiting the revenues from oil and gas exports is not enough to defend Ukraine as long as manufacturers continue to supply the Russian military industry with necessary equipment and components."

In the first half of 2022, Russian residents earned $74 billion more than they spent each quarter on average. However, recent data suggests that the surplus has shrunk to an average of $14 billion per quarter in 2023. Despite the decrease in the surplus, there is still a discrepancy between Russian and non-Russian data, making it difficult to interpret the situation accurately. Capital flight is believed to be the main reason for the financial outflows from Russia since the start of the war."

However, there is a lack of calls for oil and gas companies to increase capital expenditure, and the decline in New Energies equities suggests slower growth in that sector. The article also mentions rising tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, which could impact OPEC spare capacity and energy commodity prices. The traditional energy sector is seen as under-appreciated, and there may be value in some New Energies equities in the future.

However, this high multiple is due to the company's low estimated earnings, not its valuation. The P/E multiple is a useful piece of information when combined with a sense of the trajectory of earnings, but it has limitations. It does not determine whether a stock is attractive on its own. Factors such as the growth potential of the business and external influences need to be considered. The P/E multiple is a rule of thumb and should be used as a marker of expectations rather than valuation. It provides a starting point for research, but it's up to the individual investor to determine if the market's expectations are accurate. Low P/E stocks have historically underperformed high P/E stocks, but there is no one right answer in any environment.

The drugs' impact on consumer behavior and the market is significant, particularly considering the importance of \"super consumers\" who drive a large portion of sales for certain industries. However, there are concerns about the long-term effectiveness of GLP-1 drugs and potential side effects.

Supporters of the 70-year-old economist have organized a \"National Townhall for Justice Roadshow\" to advocate for a royal pardon. However, it is unlikely that Najib can be pardoned unless his other court cases are dismissed. Despite being in jail, Najib remains a powerful political figure and is believed to control a significant amount of political funds. Many fear that without him, Malaysia could fall into the hands of Islamist fundamentalists. However, it is important to remember Najib's involvement in corruption and other crimes. Police found a massive amount of stolen wealth, including jewelry, handbags, and cash, at his residence. He is also accused of ordering the murder of a former lover who knew too much about the 1MDB scandal. If Najib is pardoned, he could potentially regain power and continue his corrupt practices."

        "summary": "The article discusses the recent conflict between Hamas and Israel, highlighting the lack of voice and representation for the people of Gaza. It points out that there have been no free elections in Gaza for the past 17 years, and the leaders of Hamas, like Ismail Haniyeh, do not live in Gaza and do not have the mandate of the people. The author questions who made the decision for Hamas to go to war and suggests that they may have received instructions from the Muslim Brotherhood in Qatar or Iran. The article argues that Hamas has no chance of victory against Israel, as Israel has a much larger military and controls essential resources like water, food, and electricity in Gaza. The author speculates that Hamas may have started the war to gain financial support and remind the world of its existence. The article concludes by suggesting that the conflict in the Middle East will continue for decades due to the competing interests of Iran, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states, and criticizes the region's leaders as being \"insane.\""

        "summary": "Hezbollah, a terrorist organization with a strong presence in Latin America, has a longstanding relationship with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and is involved in criminal activities such as money laundering and human smuggling. They have a particularly robust relationship with the Communist regime in Venezuela, where they work together to build transnational organized crime networks. Hezbollah operatives are provided with state-sponsored cover identities and access to Venezuela's airline and banking systems, allowing them to move freely in the Western Hemisphere. The influx of Venezuelans crossing the US southern border provides an opportunity for Hezbollah operatives to infiltrate the country. Hezbollah is known for its long-term planning and stockpiling of explosives, as well as cultivating contacts for firearms. They have also created target packages on potential targets in cities like New York, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. Despite the focus on the Middle East, it is important to recognize that Hezbollah is already present in the United States and poses a significant threat."

The Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) is highlighted as a group at the heart of the growing \"protest\" movement, which has been linked to terror groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The SJP is also connected to the American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), an organization whose leaders include former Islamic terrorists. The article argues that these radical leftist groups, including SJP, are not simply protesting but explicitly calling for violence and destruction in solidarity with Hamas. Law enforcement agencies across the US have gone on alert in response to the rising threat level, with enhanced security measures and increased patrols of Jewish houses of worship, Jewish-owned businesses, and Israeli diplomatic buildings. The article concludes by suggesting that the nation has lost its way, citing examples such as the US President giving billions to the ayatollahs and the President's special envoy to Iran having his security clearance suspended for giving classified information to Iran."

The referendum was overwhelmingly rejected, with only around 40% voting in favor and at least 5 states not carrying the constitutional amendment. Many Indigenous Australians also voted against 'The Voice' due to concerns about representation and the fear that it would be controlled by self-appointed activists. The article highlights the failure of the 'yes' campaign to address these concerns and the labeling of 'no' voters as racist. It also raises questions about the allocation of funds for Indigenous Australians and the lack of transparency and accountability. The article suggests that the defeat of 'The Voice' referendum may set back the cause of Indigenous Australians and calls for further investigation into corruption and the representation of Indigenous Australians. The article concludes by comparing the referendum to the failed 1999 referendum on Australia becoming a republic and warns of potential consequences for the prime minister."

The government debt is expected to surpass RM 1.5 trillion. The budget papers forecasted growth at 4-5 percent, but there may be a tax collection shortfall if there is an economic slowdown. Little has been done to broaden the tax base, and the focus has been on a 10 percent capital gains tax and a tax on luxury goods. The budget includes spending on SME development, flood mitigation, food security, and welfare, similar to previous governments. Civil servants will receive incentives and increased pension payouts, which make up a significant portion of government expenditure. There is no effort to rein in public sector expenditure, raising concerns about productivity. The budget also includes plans for green initiatives, such as the use of solar panels and electric vehicles, but there are questions about the practicality and the need to import these technologies. The budget has faced criticism for using public funds for infrastructure projects and land purchases by government-linked companies. Overall, the budget has been seen as lacking significant changes in policies."

They have uncovered deficiencies in the royal family, politicians' hypocrisy, and cases of marginalized individuals.

However, bloggers face attacks from wealthy corporations who take advantage of weak libel laws. The marginalized in society are often the only ones who support and appreciate the work of bloggers.

Calls for a royal commission into child sexual abuse in Aboriginal communities were rejected by both Labor and the Greens. The refusal to investigate alleged corruption within the 'Aboriginal industry' and child sexual abuse effectively protects a group of elites and marginalizes rural Aboriginals. The government's actions cast doubts over its sincerity and willingness to listen to Aboriginal voices.

Some families are refusing to leave and are prepared to go to prison. The residents are disappointed with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who obtained a reprieve but has not intervened further. The evictions are not for public facilities but for the benefit of the developer, with government assistance. The residents, mostly pensioners, were squatters on the land for generations and were provided with the right to residence in the 1970s. The evictions are seen as corporate gangsterism and an example of the elite taking advantage of the powerless residents.

The main issue in Malaysian politics is not ideological differences, but rather clashes between personalities. The constant changes in leadership have led to political instability. The 'unity government' could provide stability and clarity for Malaysians, but it needs PAS more than PAS needs it. PAS believes it can form a strong and stable government on its own after the next general election. The 'unity government' must now strategize to maintain power in the upcoming election."

This could lead to a loss of control over crucial infrastructure if Chinese suppliers become inaccessible. The rest of the world should be wary of becoming dependent on China for these supplies, as it would be difficult and costly to regain manufacturing expertise and capacity if access is lost. In other news, Microsoft is reportedly close to unveiling its Athena AI Accelerator Chip, which it has been developing since 2019. The chip is expected to compete with Nvidia's offerings and could provide benefits for hyperscalers by reducing costs and increasing control over hardware. Nvidia, on the other hand, is attempting to reduce its reliance on hyperscalers by building its own cloud service and leasing data center space. However, regulators' attacks on Big Tech are seen as unsavory, and there is a need for a substantive debate on how to best deal with the power amassed by these companies.

Dollar Tree, in particular, has self-help opportunities to improve sales productivity and operating efficiency. The report also praises the management team, led by Chairman/CEO Rick Dreiling, who has a track record of success in the industry. The market is currently extrapolating recent issues at Dollar General to Dollar Tree, but the report argues that Dollar Tree is contributing to Dollar General's woes and is ahead in its investment cycle.

The main borrowers in the fed funds market are the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks (FBO branches), while domestic banks also borrow but at smaller volumes. FBO branches borrow in the fed funds market because they have limited access to deposits and face lower borrowing costs compared to domestic banks. Domestic banks increase their borrowing when aggregate reserves decline. The main lenders in the fed funds market are the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), which lend to their members through collateralized loans. FHLBs hold liquidity portfolios and do not earn interest on their balances at the central bank, creating an incentive for them to lend at rates below the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate. Domestic depository institutions also lend in the fed funds market but at small volumes due to their ability to earn the IORB rate.

However, saving behavior has diverged since then, with the U.S. saving rate dropping below pre-pandemic levels while saving rates in other countries remain above pre-pandemic levels. As a result, U.S. consumers have been spending down their excess savings while excess savings in other countries remain untapped. This divergence helps explain why U.S. GDP has returned to its pre-pandemic trend path while GDP levels in other high-income economies remain below trend. The drawdown in U.S. excess savings has contributed to U.S. GDP growth, while weak consumer spending has acted as a drag on the recoveries of other countries. The reasons for this divergence in saving behavior are unclear, but it may be related to differences in the drivers of excess saving, such as unexpected income windfalls in the U.S. The spending down of excess savings in the U.S. has supported growth despite lagging real income and tighter financial conditions."

        "summary": "Large firms, including both domestic and multinational companies, generate positive total factor productivity (TFP) spillovers to their domestic suppliers, according to a study by Mary Amiti, C\u00e9dric Duprez, Jozef Konings, and John Van Reenen. The study, which used firm-to-firm transaction data for Belgian firms between 2002 and 2014, found that firms that started selling to a \"superstar\" firm experienced around 7 to 8 percent higher TFP than firms that did not have a relationship with a superstar firm. The spillovers were observed for all types of superstar firms, including large firms, multinationals, and exporters. The study also found that forming relationships with superstar firms led to increases in sales, intermediate inputs, labor, capital, and the number of buyers for supplier firms. The spillovers were attributed to factors such as the transfer of know-how, access to new networks of potential customers, and signaling effects. The findings suggest that allowing superstar firms to grow and form relationships with less successful firms can have advantages for the economy."

        "summary": "A recent study has found significant evidence of racial disparities in the placement of children into foster care in the United States. Black children are 50% more likely to be placed into foster care than white children who have the same potential for experiencing maltreatment if left at home. The study used a quasi-experimental approach to measure unwarranted racial disparities by examining the placement rates of case investigators in Michigan. The findings suggest that racial discrimination may be a factor in the disparities observed. However, it is also important to consider the risk of subsequent maltreatment when assessing the placement disparities. The study found that the disparities were driven by children who had a potential for maltreatment if left at home. The research also suggests that higher placement rates among Black children may offer protection to those at risk of maltreatment. The study highlights the need for policies that aim to reduce racial disparities in foster care placement and improve family well-being."

        "published_date": "2023-10-17",
        "summarized_date": "2023-10-20",
        "summary": "The article discusses the evolution of liquidity in the U.S. Treasury securities market in 2023. The market experienced a worsening of liquidity in March 2023 after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, but quickly improved to levels similar to the previous year. Liquidity in the market is important for various purposes, including financing the U.S. government, managing interest rate risk, and implementing monetary policy. The article examines three commonly used measures of liquidity: bid-ask spread, order book depth, and price impact. These measures indicate that liquidity worsened in March 2023 but returned to levels similar to the previous year within a month. The increase in volatility due to the failures of the banks explains the observed patterns in liquidity. The analysis also shows that liquidity in 2023 is consistent with the historical relationship between liquidity and volatility. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for continued vigilance and efforts to enhance the market's resilience."

        "summary": "Consumer spending in the US has been stronger than expected, with real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) growing faster than predicted. The strength of consumption can be attributed to factors such as the fast rollout of vaccines, larger-than-expected fiscal stimulus, and low interest rates. While there is uncertainty about the level of excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, a broader assessment of households' financial positions is more important than excess savings alone. The role of debt in supporting consumption is examined, with households benefiting from lower mortgage payments and cash-out refinances. Other forms of debt, such as student loans and credit cards, have also contributed to available funds for consumption. Indicators of households' financial health, such as delinquency rates and consumer expectations, suggest that the household sector is in a strong position. However, the end of very low interest rates and the resumption of student loan payments may tighten household finances in the future."

        "published_date": "2023-10-18",
        "summarized_date": "2023-10-20",
        "summary": "The end of the federal student loan payment pause has led to an analysis of borrower expectations regarding the impact of the payment resumption on future spending growth, credit delinquency, and the economy. The findings suggest that the resumption of payments will have a relatively small overall effect on consumption, with a 0.1 percentage point reduction in aggregate spending from August levels. Student loan delinquency rates are expected to return to pre-pandemic levels. Low-income borrowers, female borrowers, those with less than a bachelor's degree, and those who were not in repayment before the pandemic are more likely to expect missed student loan payments. The survey also reveals that enrollment in income-driven repayment (IDR) plans is expected to increase, particularly among low-income borrowers. Borrowers anticipate a decrease in average monthly spending of around $56 per month when payments resume. The likelihood of missing a student loan payment is higher for female borrowers and those with lower household incomes. However, expectations for missing non-student loan payments are more similar across groups. Overall, the impact of the payment resumption on consumption and delinquency is expected to be relatively modest, partly due to borrowers already adjusting their savings and consumption decisions in anticipation of the resumption."

        "summary": "China is unlikely to achieve its goal of reaching the per capita income of a mid-level developed country by 2035, according to economists Hunter L. Clark and Matthew Higgins. They argue that China's rapid growth is facing challenges such as population aging, diminishing returns to its investment-centered growth model, increased state management of the economy, credit issues in real estate, and limited access to foreign technologies. Even with generous assumptions about future growth, China is projected to close only a fraction of the income gap with high-income countries. The authors also highlight the constraints on China's future growth, including declining labor inputs due to population aging and diminishing returns to capital accumulation. They argue that achieving the necessary productivity growth to meet income goals is unlikely, given that China's productivity growth is already high and historical precedents show that very few countries have achieved such growth rates. Additionally, the authors point out the structural headwinds, such as state management of the economy, institutional development, the need to rebalance the economy, and high levels of private and government debt. The authors conclude that while China has strengths, such as a well-educated population and technological advancements, the odds of achieving the income growth target are stiff."

While some argue that buybacks are superior to dividends due to tax advantages and the potential for share value appreciation, the author believes that dividends are a more reliable and beneficial option. They argue that buybacks can be unpredictable and may not always increase shareholder value. The author prefers dividends because they provide a steady income and the option to reinvest the cash. They also highlight the importance of a company's history of both dividends and buybacks when analyzing investment opportunities. The article concludes by stating that while a consistent share buyback can be powerful and beneficial for dividend growth, it is not always the best capital allocation choice, and other factors such as reinvestment potential or acquisitions should also be considered."

        "summary": "Investors are continuing to pour money into US Treasuries, despite the fact that they are on track to produce negative returns for three consecutive years. This is atypical behavior, as investors typically flee asset classes that have been performing poorly. The inflow into long-duration Treasury Bond Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) has also been strong. However, if US Treasuries fail to respond to financial market stress, such as a plunge in stock prices, it could be a sign that they are losing their safe-haven status. The inability of US Treasuries to hold a brief price spurt due to recent events in Israel is not encouraging. Despite this, if US Treasuries were to surge to a yield of 6%, triggering a stock market correction, a bond market rally is likely to follow. However, the long-term outlook for US Treasuries remains bearish due to a torrent of supply and a lack of buyers. In the oil market, there has been a deep contraction in the number of Drilled, Uncompleted (DUC) wells, which is rarely discussed. This contraction has created a backlog of partially completed wells, and producers need to increase drilling activity to meet demand. The cautious consumer sentiment and deceleration in spending indicate a potential recession. Despite the current bullish sentiment in the financial media, there is a fear of missing out on the usual October rally."

However, this move is seen as misguided and impractical, as open-source technologies are globally pervasive and restricting them would be nearly impossible. The winners in this situation would be big tech incumbents, as open AI models erode the profitability of proprietary models. Additionally, charlatan DC lawmakers who are capitalizing on the fear and confusion surrounding China and AI are also benefiting from this push to restrict open source. Ironically, these restrictions would actually benefit China by making its AI capabilities appear stronger than they actually are. Restricting open source would also have negative consequences, such as stifling innovation and collaboration, and wasting the talent and identity of programmers and developers, particularly in China. Ultimately, this move to restrict open source in the name of competition with China is undemocratic and goes against the values of transparency, openness, and collaboration that open source represents."

The company's power trading strategy involves buying electricity at a fixed price and using it to mine bitcoin. If spot electricity prices are higher than what the company can earn by mining bitcoin, Riot can sell the electricity back into the market and take the spread. Riot's presence in Texas is argued to help the grid by promoting green energy and easing strain during peak demand periods. However, the company's strategy comes with tradeoffs, including a firm obligation to purchase a certain amount of electricity regardless of mining profitability and exposure to forward power prices. Riot's financial performance is highly correlated to the price of bitcoin, and falling bitcoin prices have led to significant margin pressure for the company."

The currency market has seen a return of flows to the US dollar, with the yen and Swiss franc performing well as defensive currencies. Natural gas prices have surged, and Chevron has temporarily halted production at one of its Israeli fields. The IMF has released new forecasts for the global economy, predicting a worsening of global growth, particularly in Europe and China. Inflation is expected to decrease globally, and there are concerns about China's financial stability due to the real estate crisis. The CPI in the US has come out slightly higher than expected, with energy costs decreasing. In Europe, there are some signs of improvement, but growth remains weak, especially in Germany. The upcoming week will provide important economic updates on growth and inflation in various countries.

The publishing unit is the third-largest publisher worldwide and is impacted by factors such as the price of paper and the success of blockbuster authors. The travel retail unit manages shops in airports and train stations and has seen good results due to increased activity in regional airports and the return of Asian passengers. Lagard\u00e8re is optimistic about the future and is working on a strategic plan and financial budget for the next five years. The company can deliver sustainable growth without acquisitions, but it remains open to potential deals. Vivendi has a put option that could allow it to acquire up to 80% of Lagard\u00e8re, but the company will remain publicly traded. Lagard\u00e8re's management is focused on achieving a record current operating income and has set performance targets related to free cash flow, operating margin, and return on capital employed. The article suggests that Lagard\u00e8re is a better investment option compared to Vivendi, citing the presence of important minority shareholders and a higher potential market value."

        "summary": "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) communicates monetary policy through the federal funds rate, which is the rate for short-term lending and borrowing of central bank reserves in the U.S. The market for federal funds has changed since the global financial crisis, with a decrease in daily trading volume. The main borrowers in the fed funds market are the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks (FBO branches), while domestic banks also borrow but at smaller volumes. FBO branches borrow in the fed funds market because they have limited access to deposits and face lower borrowing costs compared to domestic banks. Domestic banks borrow more when aggregate reserves decline. The main lenders in the fed funds market are the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), which lend to their members through collateralized loans. FHLBs hold liquidity portfolios and do not earn interest on their balances at the central bank, creating an incentive for them to lend at rates below the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate. Domestic depository institutions also lend in the fed funds market but at small volumes due to their ability to earn the IORB rate."

        "summarized_date": "2023-10-20",
        "summary": "Household saving rates in the United States and other high-income economies increased during the pandemic due to reduced spending and government income support. However, saving behavior has diverged since then, with the U.S. saving rate dropping below pre-pandemic levels while saving rates in other countries remain above pre-pandemic levels. As a result, U.S. consumers have been spending down their excess savings while foreign consumers have not. This divergence helps explain why U.S. GDP has returned to its pre-pandemic trend path while GDP levels in other high-income economies remain below trend. The drawdown in U.S. excess savings has contributed to the country's economic growth, while weak consumer spending has acted as a drag on the recoveries of foreign economies. The reasons for this divergence in saving behavior are unclear, but it may be related to differences in the drivers of excess saving, such as unexpected income windfalls in the U.S. The spending down of excess savings in the U.S. has supported growth despite lagging real income and tighter financial conditions."

        "published_date": "2023-10-12",
        "summarized_date": "2023-10-20",
        "summary": "Large firms, including both domestic and multinational companies, generate positive total factor productivity (TFP) spillovers to their domestic suppliers, according to a study by Mary Amiti, C\u00e9dric Duprez, Jozef Konings, and John Van Reenen. The study, which used firm-to-firm transaction data for Belgian firms between 2002 and 2014, found that firms that started selling to a \"superstar\" firm experienced around 7 to 8 percent higher TFP than firms that did not have a relationship with a superstar firm. The spillovers were observed for all types of superstar firms, including large firms, multinationals, and exporters. The study also found that forming relationships with superstar firms led to increases in sales, intermediate inputs, labor, capital, and the number of buyers for supplier firms. The spillovers were attributed to factors such as the transfer of know-how, access to new networks of potential customers, and signaling effects. The findings suggest that allowing superstar firms to grow and form relationships with less successful firms can have advantages for the economy."

        "summary": "A recent study has found significant evidence of racial disparities in the placement of children into foster care in the United States. Black children are 50% more likely to be placed into foster care than white children who have the same potential for experiencing maltreatment if left at home. The study used a quasi-experimental approach to measure unwarranted racial disparities by examining the placement rates of case investigators in Michigan. The findings suggest that racial discrimination may be a factor in the disparities observed. However, it is also important to consider the risk of subsequent maltreatment when assessing these disparities. The study found that the disparities were driven by children who had a potential for maltreatment if left at home. The research also suggests that higher placement rates among Black children may offer protection to those at risk of maltreatment. The study highlights the need for policies that aim to reduce racial disparities in foster care placement while also improving family well-being."

        "published_date": "2023-10-17",
        "summarized_date": "2023-10-20",
        "summary": "The article discusses the evolution of liquidity in the U.S. Treasury securities market in 2023. The market experienced a worsening of liquidity in March 2023 after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, but quickly improved to levels similar to the previous year. Liquidity in the market is important for various purposes, including financing the U.S. government, managing interest rate risk, and implementing monetary policy. The article examines three commonly used measures of liquidity: bid-ask spread, order book depth, and price impact. These measures indicate that liquidity worsened in March 2023 but returned to levels similar to the previous year within a month. The increase in volatility due to the failures of the banks explains the observed patterns in liquidity. The analysis also shows that liquidity in 2023 is consistent with the historical relationship between liquidity and volatility. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for continued vigilance and efforts to enhance the market's resilience."

        "summary": "Consumer spending in the US has been stronger than expected, with real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) growing faster than predicted. The strength of consumption can be attributed to factors such as the fast rollout of vaccines, larger-than-expected fiscal stimulus, and low interest rates. While there is uncertainty about the level of excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, a broader assessment of households' financial positions is more important than excess savings alone. The role of debt in supporting consumption is examined, with households benefiting from lower mortgage payments and cash-out refinances. Other forms of debt, such as student loans and credit cards, have also contributed to available funds for consumption. Indicators of households' financial health, such as delinquency rates and consumer expectations, suggest that the household sector is in a strong position. However, the end of very low interest rates and the resumption of student loan payments may tighten household finances in the future."

        "published_date": "2023-10-18",
        "summarized_date": "2023-10-20",
        "summary": "The end of the federal student loan payment pause has led to an analysis of borrower expectations regarding the impact of the payment resumption on future spending growth, credit delinquency, and the economy. The findings suggest that the resumption of payments will have a relatively small overall effect on consumption, with a 0.1 percentage point reduction in aggregate spending from August levels. Student loan delinquency rates are expected to return to pre-pandemic levels. Low-income borrowers, female borrowers, those with less than a bachelor's degree, and those who were not in repayment before the pandemic are more likely to expect missed student loan payments. The survey also revealed that enrollment in income-driven repayment (IDR) plans is expected to increase, particularly among low-income borrowers. Borrowers anticipate a decrease in average monthly spending of around $56 per month when payments resume. The likelihood of missing a student loan payment is higher for female borrowers and those with lower household incomes. However, expectations for missing non-student loan payments are more similar across groups. Overall, the impact of the payment resumption on consumption and delinquency is expected to be relatively modest, partly due to borrowers already adjusting their savings and consumption decisions in anticipation of the resumption."

        "summary": "China is unlikely to achieve its goal of reaching the per capita income of a mid-level developed country by 2035, according to economists Hunter L. Clark and Matthew Higgins. They argue that China's rapid growth is facing challenges such as population aging, diminishing returns to its investment-centered growth model, increased state management of the economy, credit issues in real estate, and limited access to foreign technologies. Even with generous assumptions about future growth, China is projected to close only a fraction of the income gap with high-income countries. The authors also highlight the constraints on China's future growth, including declining labor inputs due to population aging and diminishing returns to capital accumulation. They argue that achieving the necessary productivity growth to meet income goals is unlikely, given that China's productivity growth is already high and historical precedents show that very few countries have achieved such growth rates. Additionally, the authors point out the structural headwinds, such as state management of the economy, institutional development, the need to rebalance the economy, and high levels of private and government debt. The authors conclude that while China has strengths, such as a well-educated population and technological advancements, the odds of achieving the income growth target are stiff."

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The author of this article responds to a dispute with Matt Yglesias regarding the polarization of American politics. The author argues that the Republican Party has become an extreme-right party, comparable to Fidesz in Hungary, while the Democratic Party is a moderate party of the center and center-left. They claim that the rise of Trump has solidified the transition of the Republican Party to an organization of the far-right. The author criticizes an article by Yglesias titled "Polarization is a choice," stating that it promotes a false equivalence between the two parties. They argue that the polarization in American politics is primarily driven by the radicalization of the Republican Party and the interaction between Republican voters and right-wing media. The author concludes that the analysis of the US political scene as a contest between two normal political parties is fundamentally wrong and that the intention to establish a permanent right-wing dictatorship is evident.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The author expresses both hope and concern about the upcoming release of the government's Employment White Paper. The change in title from "Full Employment" to a more general one is seen as discouraging. The author questions how the government's commitment to sustained and inclusive full employment can be reconciled with the Reserve Bank's focus on an inflation target. The author also mentions having written an article explaining why the NAIRU model, which the Reserve Bank follows, is not supported by economic experience.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Australia's Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, and former Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, are being criticized for their handling of climate change. The current Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, and his deputy, Tanya Plibersek, are also facing backlash for their lack of action on climate change. The country is currently experiencing wildfires, and the government's response to the crisis is being seen as inadequate. Critics argue that the leaders are prioritizing the interests of climate change deniers within their own party over the wishes of their supporters and voters. The New York Times has published an advertisement calling on Australia to ramp up its climate ambitions. The ad highlights the urgency of the climate crisis and the need for immediate action. The article suggests that the leaders' inaction on climate change is damaging Australia's reputation on the world stage.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the author's opinion on the effectiveness of the French construction program for nuclear power in the 1970s and 1980s, known as the Messmer Plan. The author argues that the success of the program was due to the power of the French state at the time, which cannot be replicated today. The author suggests that the Messmer Plan would have been more effective if it had been applied to solar and wind energy instead of nuclear power. The article was published in Crikey, an Australian online magazine.</p>

The Greens party managed to secure an additional $3 billion for the program over three years, effectively tripling its size.

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses a proposed amendment to the second rule of style from George Polya's book "How to Solve It." The original rule advises to say one thing at a time when you have two things to say. The author suggests amending the rule to say "say first one, then stop" instead of saying both things. Another colleague suggests a more cynical amendment, stating that when you have two things to say, it's better to say nothing because nobody wants to hear what you have to say.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Trilogiq, a company that develops modular systems for logistics, is considered undervalued by French investors due to its low market cap and high net cash position. The company's Q1 2023 sales have increased by 15%, and a cost reduction program is expected to bring about operational profitability. Trilogiq's EBITDA is currently at €0.6 million but is expected to improve. The company's net cash position is also expected to benefit from higher interest rates. Trilogiq has two regulated agreements with its CEO, who owns patents that contribute significantly to sales and gross margin. The CEO grants a non-exclusive license to Trilogiq for these patents, and the fee is calculated as 7% of the sales of the products. The fee for these patents is capped at €300,000. The company has not paid dividends since 2014 but has conducted a successful buyback of shares in 2019. Despite its positive attributes, the author of the article chooses not to invest in Trilogiq due to a lack of alignment with management.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the negative impact of social media algorithms on users and proposes a different approach. It argues that algorithms serve the basest version of ourselves, appealing to our lizard brain and bypassing our values and aspirations. The article suggests that online spaces should be optimized for reading what users care about, rather than promoting endless scrolling and negative emotions. It highlights Substack as a platform that connects readers directly with writers and creators, offering a different set of rules from legacy social media. The article mentions upcoming improvements to the Substack app that will support discovery and maintain the direct relationship between readers and writers. It emphasizes Substack's commitment to serving the best version of users and building a new economic engine for culture.

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the Federal Reserve's approach to interest rate hikes and its long-run estimate. Despite raising overnight rates, the Fed has not adjusted its long-run estimate of 2.5% since 2020. The article suggests that this static estimate may be a policy decision driven by factors such as credibility and duration risk. The Fed's approach of short-term hikes combined with a static long-run estimate softens the impact of rate hikes and allows borrowers to lock in debt at advantageous long-term fixed rates. However, the Fed has been forced to push up its dot plot for the next several years, leading to higher long-term interest rates. The recent FOMC meeting surprised the market by removing two rate cuts from its projections for 2024 and raising its rate guidance for 2024 and 2025. This adjustment in guidance has put pressure on the long-end of the yield curve, with the entire U.S. Treasury yield curve sitting at cycle highs. Overall, the article suggests that the Fed's approach indicates a shift in its opinion on the neutral rate in a post-COVID economy.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article discusses the potential investment opportunity in the Japanese yen. The author believes that the yen is undervalued and presents a long-term investment opportunity. They mention that the Bank of Japan's yield curve control policy, which artificially suppresses interest rates, may be coming to an end, which could lead to a rally in the yen. However, despite this potential catalyst, the yen has not experienced a significant price surge. The article includes charts showing the exchange rate between the yen and the dollar over time. The author acknowledges that there may be a drag or friction cost when holding yen positions due to the wide spread between US T-bill rates and short rates in Japan. Overall, the author remains optimistic about the yen as a long-term investment opportunity.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Sleep Country, a Canadian mattress retailer, is facing challenges to its competitive advantage, or "moat," due to increased competition and changing consumer preferences. The company's moat, which is its ability to maintain a strong market position and generate sustainable profits, is being threatened by online mattress retailers and the rise of bed-in-a-box companies. Sleep Country's traditional brick-and-mortar model is being disrupted by these new players who offer convenience and lower prices. Additionally, the company's focus on selling mattresses may limit its ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences for other sleep-related products. Despite these challenges, Sleep Country has taken steps to defend its moat, such as expanding its product offerings and investing in technology to enhance the customer experience. However, it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be enough to maintain its competitive advantage in the long term.</p>

        "summary": "Russian aluminum producer Rusal, the world's third-largest, is well-positioned to weather geopolitical challenges and capture market share when conditions normalize, according to a report by Altraman's Russia trip. Rusal has reduced its exposure to the US market due to trade barriers and tariffs on Russian imports, and has shifted its sales focus from Europe to Asia. The company is also seeking to conduct more sales in non-USD currencies and diversify its funding sources. Rusal's low-cost green aluminum advantages, stable demand profile, and prudent approach make it a strong player in the industry. However, the report notes that the lack of catalysts and ongoing geopolitical tensions will likely prevent a re-rating of the company's stock. The report also suggests that Rusal bonds could offer an attractive investment opportunity in the medium term, with an AA+ rating from China Chengxin Credit Ratings."

        "summary": "China is actively seeking to regain its historic position as a dominant world power and challenge the United States' role as the global leader. Chinese President Xi Jinping has been positioning himself as the chief advocate for China's rise to power. China's efforts to exert influence abroad include economic investments through the Belt and Road Initiative, linguistic influence by promoting closer relations with non-Western countries, political influence through initiatives like the Global Development Initiative, and information influence through propaganda and censorship. China's actions have gained traction abroad, as evidenced by a report released by the U.S Department of State on China's efforts to reshape the global information environment. However, maintaining influence is challenging and can easily be destroyed."

        "summary": "Italian government bond yields, or BTPs, have performed well over the past year despite the increase in global yields. The spread between BTPs and bunds has remained below 200bps, compared to a spread of 300bps in 2018. The main buyers of BTPs have been Italian households and corporates, who have shifted their investments from broad money to government securities. The European Central Bank (ECB) has also played a role in supporting BTP performance through its purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP). However, the ECB's purchases have been relatively small and cannot fully explain the positive performance of BTPs. Overall, the contained yield spreads and strong demand from domestic investors have contributed to the favorable performance of Italian government bonds."

He highlights the importance of finding ways to exploit lower-grade, cheaper coals and the inventors involved in this transition. He also points out the overlooked significance of lime in agriculture and its impact on productivity. Additionally, the author explores how the availability of coal led to an increase in grain production and the abundance of muscle power, particularly horses, which were used for various industrial tasks. The author also mentions the collapse of the Dutch Republic's industries during its Golden Age and dismisses the theory that it was due to a lack of energy sources. Overall, the author provides a glimpse into his research findings and the importance of understanding historical energy transitions."

        "summary": "Tech stocks experienced a steep sell-off, with the Nasdaq entering correction territory, due to concerns over weaker ad sales. Meta initially beat earnings estimates but reversed course during the conference call, leading to a negative outlook for ad sales. As a result, stock index futures are pointing to a lower open, particularly in the tech sector. Bonds have not been affected by the sell-off, with the 10-year yield remaining unchanged. In terms of commodities, WTI crude oil is down 1.5% while copper is up 0.6%. Several companies, including UPS, Hershey, Northrop Gruman, and Southwest Airlines, have reported earnings, with mixed results. After the market close, Amazon, Intel, Chipotle, and Ford are among the companies expected to report earnings. Economic data to be released includes the European Central Bank's decision on interest rates, third-quarter GDP growth, durable goods orders, initial jobless claims, and pending home sales. The tech sell-off may indicate a broader slowdown in ad spending, which could lead to job losses and impact the services sector. While the situation is currently isolated to tech, it could spread to other sectors."

The article highlights that the credit cycle is influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, interest rates, and investor sentiment. It also mentions that understanding the credit cycle is important for businesses and investors to make informed decisions about borrowing and lending. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for caution during periods of easy credit, as it can lead to excessive borrowing and financial instability."

        "summary": "Recent reports suggest that population immunity from prior infections and vaccinations is the main driver of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Currently, the leading variant in the United States is HV.1, a descendant of EG.5.1 and the family of recombinant XBB variants. However, a hyper-mutated variant called BA.2.86, also known as \"Pirola,\" has emerged and carries over 40 new mutations, including 34 in the spike protein alone. This variant is concerning because it has a high affinity for the ACE2 receptor and may have enhanced transmissibility. Another variant, JN.1, has shown a weak neutralizing antibody response to breakthrough infections. The L455S mutation in JN.1 promotes immune evasion. JN.1 has been detected in several countries, including France, the UK, and the US. It is unclear whether JN.1 will lead to a significant rise in Covid cases or how well our immune response will protect against it. The emergence of these new variants highlights the need for better vaccines to combat the evolving virus. In the meantime, getting a booster shot is recommended, especially for older individuals or those with compromised immune systems. Non-pharmacologic measures, such as preventive measures against respiratory viruses, are also important."

        "summary": "Warren Buffett has resumed his purchases of Occidental Petroleum after a four-month hiatus, acquiring 3,921,835 shares at an average cost of $62.83. This is the highest price Buffett has paid for the stock, as he has typically not been willing to pay over $60. Berkshire now owns 25.8% of Occidental's common stock. The purchases come as Chevron announced its intention to acquire Hess in a $53 billion all-stock deal, and Exxon made a deal to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources for $60 billion. Buffett's investments in Occidental and Chevron are seen as statements on the continuing importance of oil in the global economy. The potential for a broader conflict in the Middle East and recent dealmaking by Chevron and Exxon may have influenced Buffett's purchases. Berkshire is likely to release its third-quarter earnings soon, which may reveal additional purchases of Chevron stock."

Google Cloud revenue growth slowed but still reached 22%. The company's earnings per share (EPS) increased by 18.8% year-to-date. Despite a decline in pre-market trading, Alphabet shares are still up 37% since January 2021. The company believes that the post-results decline was an overreaction, as it neglects the strong growth in the core advertising business. Google Advertising has returned to its normal growth trajectory, with total advertising revenues showing a ~15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for each quarter this year. YouTube ad revenues have also rebounded, with a 12.5% year-on-year growth. Google Cloud revenues were up 22% year-on-year in Q3, although there was a slight deceleration from Q2. The company has shown cost discipline, with costs growing less than revenues in Q3. Alphabet's net income was 41.5% higher year-on-year in Q3, and its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) grew by 24.6%. The company's free cash flow (FCF) was $37.2 billion year-to-date, up 76% year-on-year. With a P/E ratio of 24.7x and a FCF yield of 2.8%, Alphabet shares are considered cheap, and the company is expected to return 83% by 2026."

The dam failure resulted in the deaths of at least 22 people and left over 100 missing. Environmentalists warn that similar projects in geologically risky areas, threatened by glacial lake outburst floods, earthquakes, climate change, and landslides, could lead to further devastation. The Teesta River, which is fed by glacial lakes, is particularly vulnerable to these risks. Despite opposition from local communities, the Indian government plans to construct three more \"mega Teestas\" in the Indian Himalayas. International organizations, such as International Rivers, urge the government to reconsider these plans, stating that hydropower is not a climate-friendly or sustainable energy solution. The construction of these dams also poses threats to the fragile Himalayan ecosystem and the livelihoods of indigenous communities. In addition to dam collapses, landslides and cracks in homes are concerns, as well as the disruption of migration routes and nesting areas for endangered species. The future of the Teesta River and its tributaries, including downstream in Bangladesh, is in jeopardy due to the proposed cascade of dams."

The dismissals and demotions, which include the defense minister, finance minister, and science and technology minister, suggest upheaval in China's leadership. The fact that Xi could not name a replacement for the defense minister indicates a lack of confidence in the loyalty and ability of his top military brass. The removal of Qin Gang, who was previously sacked as foreign minister, suggests Xi's failure to nurture capable diplomats. The lack of explanation for the dismissals and the downfall of Li Shangfu, the defense minister, and Qin Gang is seen as a sign of dysfunction and opacity in China's leadership. The removals also highlight the lack of pushback or disagreement with Xi's decisions, indicating his unchallenged position. However, there are still forces working to undermine Xi's position, as evidenced by the leaks and the tensions and distrust within the party leadership."

Opportunities for IWG include increasing occupancy, the growing trend of coworking and flexible working, and capital returns as debt is paid down. Risks include a recession that could reduce rates and occupancy, but could also increase occupancy if businesses downsize."

They believe that buying good, overcapitalized banks around book value can be a positive expected value bet, but with significant downside risks. The author also mentions that regional banks may engage in mergers and acquisitions to avoid regulatory burdens, which could lead to a wave of M&A activity in the future. They argue that the current environment is favorable for banks to make loans and generate positive earnings and asset values. The competitive landscape in banking has changed, with bankruptcies and funding challenges for fintech players, creating opportunities for well-capitalized banks to gain market share. The author suggests that investors should differentiate between banks by analyzing their balance sheets. Despite the fear in the market, the author believes that investing in a handful of good banks with a long-term view can result in excellent risk-adjusted returns."

The author also criticizes prominent leftists, such as Noam Chomsky and Nathan J. Robinson, for their views on foreign policy, including Chomsky's suggestion that Ukraine should make concessions to Russia and Robinson's assertion that U.S. defense spending constitutes \"plotting a genocide of Russian and Chinese people.\" The author further criticizes the socialist movement's theories of change, power, and public policy, including their embrace of faddish intellectual cults like degrowth and their opposition to housing construction and clean energy projects. The author concludes by expressing disappointment in the direction of the socialist movement and the potential for it to become a fringe group."

        "summary": "First Horizon (FHN), a regional bank with $85 billion in assets, has seen its stock price drop from $25 to $10 after a deal to be acquired by TD Bank fell through. Despite the decline, the bank's balance sheet remains solid, with conservative financing and a strong capital position. Earnings have been affected by changes in the rate environment and a one-off credit charge, but normalized earnings suggest a more accurate valuation. Shareholders currently receive a quarterly dividend, and the bank has excess capital that could potentially be used for buybacks. First Horizon currently trades at a discount to its peers, but its fundamentals and loan book are sound. Using a historical industry heuristic, the bank's valuation could be around $12.80 per share. While the banking industry as a whole has had a challenging year, owning First Horizon may be a good investment opportunity given its potential for growth and its discounted valuation."

Van Tulleken conducted an experiment where he ate an 80% ultra-processed food (UPF) diet for a month and found that he gained weight, experienced changes in brain connectivity, and had a heightened hunger hormone response. He also discovered that his identical twin brother, who at times is 20 kg heavier than him, eats a diet high in UPFs. Van Tulleken argues that UPFs, which are made with synthetic and artificial substances, are not only harmful to health but also contribute to a range of chronic conditions, including cancer, dementia, and inflammatory bowel disease. He calls for increased regulation of UPFs and highlights the need to address poverty and food deserts to improve access to healthy, unprocessed foods. Van Tulleken also challenges the prevailing beliefs surrounding calorie burning through exercise and the role of carbohydrates in weight gain, suggesting that the addictive nature of UPFs is a significant factor in the obesity epidemic."

Share cannibals can have a magical effect on earnings per share, leading to an increase in share price. A portfolio of 14 well-known share cannibals would have returned a compounded annual growth rate of 23.6% compared to the S&P 500's 12.2%. However, not all share repurchases are equal, and there are caveats to consider. Companies that engage in share repurchases should have good price discipline, sustainable repurchases in relation to fundamentals, and a track record of reducing their share count. It is also important to assess the company's moat, outlook, and whether they are serial diluters or offsetters. New rules for repurchase disclosures will be implemented in 2023 to provide greater transparency and scrutiny. Overall, identifying genuine share cannibals requires careful analysis of a company's actions and financial health."

The Cypherpunks, a group of cryptographers, mathematicians, computer scientists, and activists, played a significant role in the development of Bitcoin and other projects such as Tor, PGP, and BitTorrent. The ideas of anarcho-capitalism, as advocated by economist David D. Friedman, science fiction writer Vernor Vinge, and philosopher Ayn Rand, influenced the Cypherpunks' vision of a decentralized, anarchic digital society. Friedman's book \"The Machinery of Freedom\" and Heinlein's novel \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\" were particularly influential in shaping their ideas. Bitcoin itself can be considered existing in a state of anarchy, as it operates without a central authority controlling it. The article highlights the interconnectedness of computers, open-source software, and cryptography as key factors in enabling the creation of this digital society. Ultimately, the article suggests that the creative thinking of individuals like Friedman and the work of the Cypherpunks laid the foundation for the development of Bitcoin."

        "summary": "Hedge fund manager Lawrence Lepard believes that the US is in a \"debt doom loop\" due to the sensitivity of Federal interest expenses to rapidly growing short-term yields. Lepard points out that half of the US Federal Debt will need to be rolled over within the next three years, and with interest rates currently at 2.49%, the government will have to pay higher rates as bonds mature. With the total US Federal Debt growing at $2-3 trillion per year, Lepard predicts that in two years, interest expenses will more than double the current rate, adding another $1 trillion to the deficit. Lepard acknowledges that timing is difficult, but he believes that \"monetary debasement\" is highly likely given the system of Governments and Central Banks. He remains confident in his investment thesis and expects significant upside when the debt doom loop occurs."

        "summary": "North Korea is reportedly loading up hundreds of containers with arms and ammunition to be transported via Russia to Ukraine, indicating a new security partnership between Pyongyang and Moscow. The containers are said to be filled with Soviet-era arms, including rockets and artillery shells. It is unclear which side initiated the arms transfers, but Russia is in need of conventional artillery pieces and shells, while North Korea has an ample stock of Soviet-era arms. The speedy deliveries of these munitions follow high-level meetings between North Korean and Russian officials, including a tour of North Korean defense facilities and Russian defense industry sites. The acquisition of high-tech weapons by North Korea could pose a direct threat to South Korea, and has alarmed South Korean officials. However, it is uncertain if Moscow is prepared to strike a deal, given Russia's support of North Korea's economy and concerns about North Korea's ethical standards in using foreign technology. China, which shares a border with North Korea, is also wary of North Korea's arms shopping tours and aims to maintain a balance in its relations with Pyongyang."

        "summary": "Approximately 10 million Americans have received the Fall 2023 Covid-19 vaccine, which is only about 3% of the eligible population and significantly lower than typical flu vaccine coverage. The comparison between this year's Covid-19 coverage and last year's is complicated by the fact that states are no longer required to report vaccine uptake to the CDC. However, models suggest that Covid-19 coverage is similar to last year when considering differential reporting. The lower coverage for Covid-19 can be attributed to several factors, including the year-round circulation of the virus compared to the seasonal circulation of the flu, debates about eligibility for the vaccine, lack of access and resources, and vaccine fatigue. To improve vaccine coverage, a comprehensive approach involving various stakeholders such as friends, family, schools, pharmacies, and employers is needed. This approach should focus on increasing trust, access, and coverage of vaccines."

The author suggests that the Israel-Gaza war, along with other events such as the discourse in America and the reshaping of supply chains, can be seen as part of the great-power contest between the US and its democratic allies and an authoritarian bloc led by China and Russia. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the geopolitical context in order to make sense of economic changes and conflicts. However, the author also warns against over-applying the Cold War 2 framework and falling into conspiracy thinking. Overall, the article argues that the Israel-Gaza war is a proxy conflict in the larger context of Cold War 2."

        "summary": "Federal Reserve officials are expressing doubts about the claim that monetary policy is restrictive. They argue that current policy may actually be closer to \"neutral\" due to changes in income distribution, private sector balance sheets, and fiscal policy. Evidence from the real and financial sides of the economy suggests that policymakers should consider how they will respond if spending continues to grow faster than what is deemed sustainable. Even if short-term interest rates are not raised significantly, these pressures may prevent interest rates from being lowered in the near future. The argument that there are long and variable lags between short-term interest rates and financial conditions is flawed because financial conditions have not actually tightened. The Fed's latest Financial Stability Report acknowledges that stocks are expensive, credit spreads are tight, and property prices remain elevated. Despite an increase in default-free discount rates, the decline in risk premiums has offset this, leading to consumer and corporate borrowing remaining in line with pre-pandemic levels."

The possibility of a \"Blue-White\" unity ticket between the KMT and TPP has been discussed due to their combined potential to defeat the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate, Lai Ching-te. However, the KMT has previously insisted that their candidate should be at the top of the ticket. Hou's concession comes after Ko has consistently led in the polls. The KMT's proposal for a \"primary\" vote between the \"Hou-Ko\" ticket and the \"Ke-Hou\" ticket, with Hou as the vice president, has been criticized as disingenuous by Ko. The formation of a unity ticket poses challenges for both parties, as being on the bottom of the ticket is seen as a poor consolation prize. The KMT risks consolidating TPP as a permanent rival, while TPP risks losing its identity as an independent party. Additionally, there are voters who detest one party but support the other, making the unity ticket less effective."

While some investors believe that activist shorts are unfair and biased, others argue that they serve an important function in the market by providing new information and improving price discovery. Short sellers have the incentive to sell a stock short and profit from negative information about a company, which can help prevent losses for other shareholders. Hindenburg's report on Icahn Enterprises (IEP) was not particularly impressive as it mainly contained information that was already public. However, Hindenburg's credibility allowed it to move the stock, resulting in negative total returns for IEP. Despite the controversy surrounding activist shorts, they can provide opportunities for investors, whether they are right or wrong in their assessments. It is important to respect and listen to what activist shorts have to say, as they can provide valuable insights."

They provide insights into the overall health of the economy and help identify trends and patterns in economic activity. By tracking the percentage of industries that are expanding or contracting, diffusion indexes can indicate the direction of the economy. Two examples of diffusion indexes used in business cycles are the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) and the Tankan survey. However, in Malaysia, there are diffusion indexes that do not align with actual economic data and have been discontinued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. These indexes were incorporated into the National Recovery Council (NRC), which has not published any reports. The author argues that taxpayers have a right to know what happened and that these indexes do not reflect the actual situation on the ground. The situation is described as disorganized and lacking direction, like a chicken without a head."

        "summary": "The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) assumptions on global yields have become outdated due to recent changes in the market. The IMF's debt projections, in particular, are no longer accurate. The WEO was based on the assumption that the 10-year government bond yield for the United States would average 3.8% in 2023 and 4.0% in 2024. However, with the recent repricing of yields, the average for 2023 is projected to be 4.1% and 5.0% for 2024. This means that the analysis of public sector debt dynamics in the WEO database does not reflect the current global prospects. The projections for Italian debt-to-GDP also rely on optimistic assumptions. Despite fiscal slippage and changes in the Italian yield curve, Italian debt-to-GDP is projected to be lower than previously estimated. This is due to higher nominal GDP and a more aggressive adjustment of the primary balance. However, these projections may not be sustainable given the recent changes in global yields."

The author uses the example of Intel's stock price only declining slightly after NVIDIA's announcement, suggesting that the market may have already priced in the news or that Intel's stock was already undervalued. The article emphasizes the importance of considering both price and fundamental value when evaluating investments. It also mentions the concept of asymmetric risk-reward, where investing in undervalued stocks with low multiples can provide both downside protection and upside potential.

The war is not like previous world wars, but rather a new kind of warfare that takes place in multiple domains simultaneously. The conflict extends beyond Ukraine and the Middle East, with hot wars occurring in space, the Arctic, and the oceans. There is also a cold war being fought in Africa and the Pacific, where Russia and China are supporting uprisings and vying for influence. The lack of a comprehensive narrative to explain this larger confrontation between superpowers hinders the proper understanding and resolution of the geopolitical problem. Instead, attention is focused on the difficult questions of whether to support Israel and Ukraine and whether these conflicts can be won. However, the nature of this war requires a broader perspective, as it involves all domains and utilizes tactics such as weaponizing food and energy prices to inflict pain on civilian populations. The changing nature of warfare and the effectiveness of technology have rendered traditional weapons less significant. It is crucial to recognize the complexity and scope of this global conflict in order to address its challenges effectively."

This blanket statement fails to acknowledge the nuanced application of the principle, which is not about blocking all progress but rather being cautious in specific cases that could have serious negative systemic effects. The debate over the precautionary principle is particularly relevant in the context of artificial intelligence (AI), with Andreessen advocating for unrestricted progress while others, like Elon Musk, argue for greater caution. It is important to consider the economic motives of those involved in the AI debate and not dismiss the principle itself.

The US is also pressuring companies in countries like Japan and the Netherlands, which are crucial partners for Chinese companies building their semiconductor ecosystem. However, there is some optimism as US officials have expressed openness to input from the semiconductor industry to find ways to continue sending AI chips to China for small and medium-sized systems.

        "summary": "Tensions between China and the Philippines have escalated in the West Philippine Sea, specifically in the Second Thomas Shoal. The Philippines sent supplies to troops stationed on a World War Two-era transport ship, prompting China's coastguard to block the resupply missions. A collision occurred between Chinese and Filipino vessels, with China claiming it was attempting to block the delivery of \"illegal construction materials.\" The Philippines denounced China's actions as a violation of its sovereignty. The incident is the latest in a series of escalating conflicts between the two countries. The Philippines has vowed to conduct a quick investigation, and the US has expressed support for the Philippines, reaffirming its security pact. The Chinese foreign ministry accused the US of disregarding the facts and violating international law. The situation is complicated, as the US has a security treaty with the Philippines that obliges it to assist in the event of an armed attack. President Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos Jr. is navigating delicate relations with both the US and China. Some speculate that China may be taking advantage of the US's current focus on other global issues to assert its dominance in the region."

        "summary": "PRC ships have rammed two Philippine vessels in the South China Sea, escalating the ongoing crisis over the resupply of the grounded Sierra Madre. The US and Philippines national security advisors held a call to discuss the incident. The Philippines is using the grounded ship to secure its territory, but it may break up before the end of the year, which the PRC is waiting for to swoop in and declare possession. The Philippines needs concrete and construction materials to resupply the Sierra Madre, but it can't do it alone. If it asks the US for help, it could turn into a US-China crisis. Wang Yi, the Chinese Foreign Minister, will visit the US this week, likely as part of the effort to have General Secretary Xi Jinping attend APEC in San Francisco next month and meet with President Biden. The MSS and CCTV have released details of an alleged case of a PRC researcher becoming an American spy. Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, is being investigated by mainland authorities for tax and land use issues, which some speculate is an attempt to get the company's founder, Terry Gou, to drop out of the Taiwan presidential election. The National Financial Work Conference will convene in Beijing next week to address the local government debt crisis and the real estate debt crisis. Huijin is buying shares in ETFs and increasing stakes in big banks to support the falling stock market. Securities Times is calling for the removal of price limits on land auctions and new home prices to support the real estate market. Evan Osnos has published an article in the New Yorker about the darkening mood in China. The Party is expected to hold a Third Plenum before the end of the year, and not convening one would send a worrisome signal."

        "summary": "The author suggests a long position in GLD (gold) and a short position in TLT (long-dated treasury bonds) to capture the pro-labor political shift. The short TLT leg has been successful, with TLT falling from 160 to 83. Despite the decline, investors have been buying TLT, causing shares outstanding to quadruple since 2022. Short interest has remained low, resulting in significant losses for TLT owners and minimal gains for short sellers. The yield curve inversion made TLT an attractive short, but it has since disappeared. However, TLT is an ETF designed to remain a long-dated treasury, and its dividend yield versus cash (Fed Funds Rate) suggests it is still a good short. The author believes yields will continue to rise, making TLT an even better short. If there is a reduction in shares outstanding or an increase in short interest, a tactical cover may be considered."

        "summary": "The US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is being run down by the Biden administration due to the country's increased oil production and the wrong placement of stored oil. Some analysts believe that this is a temporary policy to keep oil prices down, but it is unlikely that the SPR will ever be refilled. The decline in US oil production is becoming more likely as Permian drillers are completing more wells than they are drilling, leading to a decrease in new production. In the renewable energy sector, the offshore wind industry is facing challenges as new investors enter the market, increasing competition for assets and diminishing returns. However, the problems faced by companies like Orsted are not a failure of government policy but rather a result of its success in attracting new investors. Tradable carbon prices remain strong, indicating that a compromise will likely be reached to support the growth of offshore wind generation. Overall, the green energy revolution is expected to continue, with declining investment in fossil energy and a need for rising energy prices to support the growing competition for green assets."

Toyota has been slow to develop full battery electric vehicles (BEVs) due to its skepticism of lithium-ion batteries, which it believes have fire risks and limited range. Instead, the company has focused on developing solid-state batteries, which it believes will overcome these limitations. The partnership with Idemitsu Kosan, a Japanese oil refiner, will help Toyota bring this technology to market. The announcement has sparked speculation about the potential disruption this could cause in the automotive industry. However, it remains to be seen if the claims about the capabilities of solid-state batteries will live up to the hype."

Lepard believes that the bond market is indicating that it will not absorb these debts at current rates and that rates will have to be much higher to attract bids. He suggests that this could ultimately force the Federal Reserve to re-stimulate the economy. Lepard's insights are considered valuable because he receives little coverage in the mainstream media."

President Joko Widodo has maneuvered Prabowo Subianto, a figure from the New Order era, into the lead as the presidential candidate and has chosen his own unqualified son, Gibran Rakabuming, as the vice presidential running mate. Critics argue that this move undermines the democratic process and could lead to a political dynasty. The Constitutional Court's decision to lower the minimum age for vice presidential candidates, allowing Gibran to run, has also been criticized as nepotistic. The situation has sparked worries about the weakening of democracy and civil liberties in Indonesia. The court's decision has the potential to trigger further political conflict in the 2024 elections. Despite the controversy, Prabowo is trying to win over Jokowi's supporters by recruiting Gibran as his deputy. Jokowi denies interfering in Gibran's nomination, but his relationship with his party, the PDIP, has deteriorated. Overall, the situation is seen as a threat to Indonesian democracy and raises concerns about the consolidation of power and the normalization of corruption, collusion, and nepotism."

The civil service, which consists of around 1.6 million employees, is heavily weighted towards Malays and other Bumiputeras, leading to a predominantly Malay culture within the service. The Gen Xers have maintained the system and prioritized the \"Malay agenda,\" while the Millennials have brought IT and cloud literacy to the forefront and prioritize clear objectives and conformity. The Millennials also have a more intense Islamic education, leading to a transformation of the \"Malay agenda\" into a \"Malay-Islamic agenda.\" The Gen Zers, who are entering the lower positions of the civil service, share the same Islam-centric worldview as the Millennials but have more self-centered values. These generational changes are expected to narrow the diversity of thinking within the civil service and create a more rules-based environment. The civil service will also face challenges in terms of a loss of historical experience and a bloated and inefficient structure. Additionally, the majority of civil servants tend to have political sympathies towards the PAS side of politics."

The Romans used elevators to transport construction materials and animals in the Colosseum. Elevators for passengers took longer to develop, with King Louis XV of France believed to be one of the first to use them. The Industrial Revolution led to the development of steam-powered elevators, but safety concerns arose after fatal accidents. Elisha Graves Otis solved this problem by inventing a safety system based on a brake. Otis Elevator Company was founded and became a leading elevator manufacturer. KONE, a Finnish manufacturer, also entered the elevator industry and is now the third largest manufacturer in the world. The elevator business is competitive, with manufacturers vying for projects and maintenance contracts. Maintenance contracts are the most lucrative part of the business, generating high gross and operating margins. Elevators can cost between \u20ac30,000 and 500,000, and each geography has different dynamics and competition. Building route density and optimization are important for success in the industry."

        "summary": "Aardman's Creature Comforts, a concept that began as a short film in 1989, has become a major success due to its unscripted, everyday human speech used as dialogue for animation. The appeal of the project lies in the ability to watch animals talk like average people about their lives, creating a mix of droll, hilarious, and tragic moments. The success of Creature Comforts is attributed to the believability of the dialogue and the creativity and experimentation of the Aardman team. The concept was initially conceived, directed, and animated by Nick Park, who faced challenges in finding the right material for the dialogue. However, the breakthrough came when they interviewed people who were in a similar situation to animals in a zoo, resulting in funnier and more honest conversations. The short film won an Oscar and led to a hit series of commercials and a major TV show. Aardman's unscripted style of dialogue has its roots in the work of Faith and John Hubley, who used improvisation and editing techniques to create authentic and natural dialogue in their animations. Creature Comforts has since become a successful TV show, with thousands of hours of interviews conducted to gather material for the characters' dialogue. The series retains the spontaneous and engaging nature of the original short film and ads, despite being pieced together from thousands of odds and ends."

In the third quarter of 2023, Lepard's fund increased in value slightly and outperformed the Gold Stock Juniors ETF, largely due to their position in Lavras Gold. Lepard acknowledges that in bear markets for gold stocks, their fund may perform worse than the benchmark, but in bull markets, they expect similar results to previous years. Lepard also highlights the worsening US fiscal doom loop."

CEOs from various companies have expressed caution and have noticed a slowdown in hiring and spending. The tightening of economic conditions may lead to sluggishness in the economy, although it may not necessarily result in a recession. The Federal Reserve is signaling that rates will need to stay higher for longer to combat inflation. Geopolitical risks, including conflicts in various regions, are also worrying company executives.

        "summary": "Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has suspended his plan to launch a sovereign wealth fund, the Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF), sparking speculation and skepticism. The president's explanation that the suspension is to make improvements to the organizational structure of the project has raised questions about the competence of lawmakers and decision-makers. The hasty process by which the fund was pushed through Congress and signed into law has also been criticized. The state-owned Land Bank and Development Bank of the Philippines have already transferred significant amounts of capital to the fund, putting their resources at risk. The suspension has led to rumors that Marcos intends to appoint his finance secretary, Benjamin Diokno, as the president and CEO of MIF, which could lead to a cabinet shakeup. However, there are concerns that the fund will fail to attract private funding support, as the Philippines is not a preferred destination for foreign investment. The weak investor interest is partly due to the country's image of lacking law and order, with high crime rates and extrajudicial killings. To attract investors and tourists, the president needs to prioritize creating a more tourist- and investor-friendly image for the country. One option is to seek funding from the country's richest individuals, who have a combined net worth of over $65 billion. However, there must be clear provisions to ensure that the fund is managed by private equity partners without government involvement. The president's goal is to raise Gross National Income per capita by 2024 and redeem the Marcos name."

They argue that despite concerns about a potential commercial real estate crisis, a recession, and rising interest rates, banks are well-prepared and have taken measures to mitigate these risks. The author points out that most banks have limited exposure to commercial real estate and have built up reserves and capital in anticipation of a recession. They also explain that the recent rise in interest rates is actually beneficial for banks, as they borrow short-term and lend long-term. The author concludes that a basket of banks trading around tangible book value could be a profitable investment, although some due diligence is required to differentiate between banks with potential asset issues and those that are well-positioned."

The company's goal is to reach ~100 million UCAN subscribers and ~70% household penetration over time. Globally, the addressable market for Netflix is at least twice the size of its current subscriber base, with the potential to capitalize on the growing demand for streaming services. Netflix's average revenues per membership (ARMs) have also increased by over 30% since the end of 2016, driven by growth in the UCAN region and higher ARMs in markets like LATAM and APAC. Despite some challenges, Netflix is poised to become a global leader in the video-on-demand industry with a subscriber base measured in the hundreds of millions."

        "summary": "The decline of state capacity in the United States has resulted in the outsourcing of government functions to nonprofits and consultants, leading to inefficiencies and waste of taxpayer money. Environmental regulation, for example, has been outsourced to the courts, causing delays and increased costs for infrastructure projects. The reliance on nonprofits and consultants also creates agency problems, as these entities may prioritize their own interests over efficient use of government funds. Additionally, the lack of a strong bureaucracy has hindered the country's ability to respond effectively to crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The author argues that it is time to bring back bureaucrats and invest in rebuilding the civil service. This would involve expanding and upgrading the federal workforce, improving tax collection, overhauling information technology systems, streamlining environmental review processes, and revitalizing public health institutions. The author emphasizes the need for a competent, well-funded bureaucracy to address current challenges and prepare for future threats, such as a potential war with China."

However, the excessive focus on reason and materialism has led to negative consequences. The rejection of metaphysics and religion has resulted in a loss of the sacred and a narrow view of reality. The Enlightenment's reliance on empirical knowledge and the belief that everything can be explained through matter has limited our understanding of consciousness and other mental phenomena. Science is slowly recognizing the limitations of a materialistic worldview and is undergoing a paradigm shift to find better explanations. It is important to acknowledge the limitations of reason and embrace a more holistic approach that integrates science, reasoning, intuition, and the sacred. Coexistence between science and the non-empirical is possible and necessary for a more comprehensive understanding of the world."

Despite the decline, the bank's balance sheet remains solid, with conservative financing and a strong capital position. Earnings have been affected by changes in the rate environment and a one-off credit charge, but normalized earnings suggest a more accurate valuation. Shareholders currently receive a quarterly dividend, and the bank has excess capital that could potentially be used for buybacks. First Horizon currently trades at a discount to its peers, but its fundamentals and loan book are sound. Using a historical industry heuristic, the bank's valuation could be around $12.80 per share. While the banking industry as a whole has had a challenging year, owning First Horizon may be a good investment opportunity given its potential for growth and its discounted valuation."

Malaysia's stance is problematic due to previous reports of a training program in Malaysia that coached Hamas fighters. The European Union, which values democracy and human rights, should apply its principles to Malaysia and make it clear that economic relations will suffer if Malaysia continues to support Hamas. Malaysia's ties with Hamas blur the line between militants and Palestinian civilians and provide a platform for an organization whose goal is to cause destruction. Malaysia's support of Hamas puts it in the company of pariah countries like Iran, Syria, and Algeria. The Malaysian government's support of Hamas is causing political isolation and may strain relations with Western partners like the United States."

Felix himself does not strictly adhere to a passive approach, but leans toward systematic value investing. His arguments are based on a simplified presentation of models such as the Grossman-Stiglitz model and various Fama-French papers, which are criticized for not adequately accounting for market realities and inefficiencies. Ralph Koijen's work is cited to counter Felix's argument that the growth of index funds won't affect markets, stating that the composition of investors in the market matters significantly. The rise of passive investing has led to a noticeable increase in valuations, especially among larger stocks. Citations of measures of \"price informativeness\" as a measure of market efficiency may miss nuanced factors such as feedback loops created by passive investing strategies. The article also highlights the irony that Felix himself does not invest in passive index funds, but follows a systematic value investing approach."

        "summary": "Philip Morris International (PMI) is facing challenges in achieving its goal of deriving 50% of net revenues from smoke-free products by 2025. The company's plans for a slower rollout of its IQOS product in the US in 2024 may hinder its progress. Additionally, flavor bans in the EU are impacting PMI's heated tobacco unit (HTU) inventories. Despite these setbacks, PMI remains confident in its ability to capture 10% of the cigarette and HTU market share in the US by 2030. The company's Q3 results showed growth in HTU volumes and an increase in IQOS users. PMI's distribution network and direct relationships with consumers are key strengths that have contributed to the success of IQOS. The company's aggressive pricing strategy and focus on smoke-free products have also driven growth. However, PMI's Wellness & Healthcare segment has struggled to find its footing and is seen as a drain on resources. Overall, PMI's ability to generate long-term value remains strong."

He also noted that the level of private sector credit, rather than the rate of growth, is the critical factor. Montier expressed concern about the risk of recession, high market valuations, and the concentration of debt by sector. He suggested three routes to protect portfolios: holding cash, using options, and using strategies with a negative correlation to tail risk. Montier discussed the challenges and expenses associated with option protection and highlighted the potential benefits of a quality minus junk strategy. He also emphasized the high valuation of quality stocks and expressed a preference for a value versus growth strategy. Montier concluded by mentioning the significant sectoral exposure of the private equity-owned corporate sector, which could have potential knock-on impacts in the event of a major credit event."

This could be an attempt to please his superior or a result of his own desire for power. These actions also highlight the larger problem of a recalcitrant cabinet that Anwar is dealing with. Some members of the cabinet are incompetent, like Fahmi, while others are directly disobeying Anwar. The blocking of websites by Fahmi is seen as a warning to Anwar about the destruction his own cabinet is causing to his government. Anwar must act quickly to prevent a disaster that could lead to his removal from office."

He argues that instead of trying to enter the successor products that are driving your business under, it is better to get out of the declining product or industry. Buffett uses the example of passenger trains being replaced by airplanes, and how the solution was not for train companies to enter the airline business, but rather to exit the passenger business altogether. He also mentions the case of television, which went from being absent in most homes to having multiple sets in almost every home, yet the profitability of U.S. TV manufacturers is likely negative. Buffett's message is that clinging to a dying product or industry is not a wise strategy, and businesses should be willing to adapt and explore new opportunities."

Despite this, the author believes that now is a good time to be buying stocks, as there is a lot of fear in the market and stocks are trading at attractive valuations. The rise in interest rates is a major concern for investors, but the author argues that the equity market never fully discounted how low interest rates were. The S&P is currently trading for just under 20x P/E, which the author believes is not a crazy number and could even be considered cheap given current interest rates. While some larger cap names trade at premium multiples, there is real value to be found in the market for investors willing to dig a little."

He learned the value of hard work and discipline while working on his family's dairy farm and dismantling cars for scrap metal. He eventually focused on selling car parts individually, which allowed him to command higher prices. He also specialized in Chrysler, Dodge, and Plymouth parts, which differentiated him from his competitors. In the 1980s, Johnson purchased BTS Auctions and transformed it into Copart Auctions. He introduced the Percentage Incentive Program (PIP), which allowed insurance companies to split the increase in price from making salvaged cars look nicer. Copart also embraced technology early on, launching an online platform for buyers to bid on cars. The company experienced significant growth and went public in 1994. It continued to expand through acquisitions and the development of a national network of yards. Copart's success can be attributed to its focus on customer needs, operational efficiency, and technological innovation."

        "summary": "The emergence of three mega risks\u2014War, Inflation/Stagflation, and Rich Country Government Debt Burdens\u2014is shaping up to add new dimensions of uncertainty to an already messy energy transition era. Rising tensions in the Middle East following the terrorist attack by Hamas in Israel add a second theatre of conflict to go along with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. After a 40-year run of contained inflation and declining interest rates, the 2020s are shaping up to be a different environment. Energy prices are likely to contribute to higher future inflation as both traditional and new energy supply are not on-track to meet global needs. The risk of adverse consequences from continuously rising government debt levels in the United States is increasing. The magnitude of yet-to-be-met energy demand among the other 7 billion people on Earth overwhelmingly points to the need for all forms of energy. Traditional energy sectors may serve as a hedge to the growing mega risks, potentially counter-balancing its recession exposure. New energy technologies have an important role to play in meeting global energy needs, but getting the economics right is more important than an impossibly fast transition."

Bridgen urged the government to prioritize the restoration of normal healthcare services and to address the underlying causes of excess deaths."

Scammers have been using authorized trust companies, preference share companies, and venture capital companies to deceive people into depositing money and making illegal investments. The scheme not only defrauds people but also helps them evade taxes. Famous individuals, lawyers, celebrities, insurance agents, and bank agents have been promoting this Ponzi scheme. Victims are tricked into signing various contracts, and when the companies are unable to repay them, they realize they are trapped and cannot retrieve their hard-earned money. Some of the companies involved in this scam include UBB Amanah Berhad, ZICO Trust Malaysia Berhad, Infinity Trustee Berhad (now known as Perintis Amanah Berhad), Global Asset Trustee Berhad, Citadel Trustee Berhad, Asia International Trust Berhad, Amanah Warisan Berhad, ACE Holding Berhad, and Pacific Trustees Group International Berhad. Lim Lip Eng has urged the government to take immediate action to protect people from falling victim to these unregulated Ponzi schemes and to impose severe penalties on the scammers involved."

        "summary": "The geopolitical risk of conflict in the Middle East continues to pose a significant threat, as seen by the steady oil prices at $90 per barrel. In an attempt to alleviate the upward pressure on oil, the US has lifted sanctions against Venezuela for six months, allowing them to tap into their significant crude reserves. Precious metals, such as gold and silver, have regained their status as safe-haven assets due to tensions in the Middle East and missile launches against Israel. Interest rates remain a focal point for investors, with long-term rates still weak and inflation expectations rising alongside the increase in oil prices. European long-term rates continue to rise, despite weak economic data. Stock markets, particularly in Europe, have been heavily impacted by selling pressure, with the DAX, Milan, and Paris indices all experiencing significant declines. Economists have conflicting opinions on the US economy, with some predicting a recession that has not materialized, while others have raised their growth projections due to robust consumer spending. The Beige Book, a monthly survey of regional Fed banks, paints a less solid economic picture. In China, despite concerns in the real estate sector, real GDP growth has accelerated, retail sales have improved, and unemployment has decreased. Central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Korea, are expected to maintain cautious monetary policies due to geopolitical uncertainties."

        "summary": "China's economic troubles, including a slowdown in growth, the techno-war with the West, and intellectual property theft, could have a significant impact on Japan's economy. Japan's exports to China, which make up a substantial portion of its GDP, have already declined, and a further decline could lead to a mild recession. The ongoing techno-war between China and the West, as well as corporate espionage, have also caused Japanese companies to slow down their investment in China. Japan's declining exports to China and its loss of market share in the country have been ongoing issues. Additionally, the tension between China and the West over technology has led to the cutting off of critical technologies to China, further impacting its economic growth potential. Japan, along with the US and Europe, has joined in restricting China's access to advanced technologies. The article highlights the vulnerability of Japan's economy to China's economic and political troubles and the need for Japan to diversify its supply chains and reduce its reliance on China."

        "summary": "Ben Graham, known for his value investing approach, made more money with GEICO than all his other investments combined. This is because value investing focuses on buying cheap stocks with a margin of safety, even if they are not of the highest quality. Graham's approach allows for companies to turn around and improve their fundamentals over time. The recent CEO change at Unity, a gaming company, did not have a lasting positive impact on the stock due to the lost trust of game developers and studios. Stanley Druckenmiller, an investment icon, takes a bottom-up approach to investing, focusing on company-specific information rather than macroeconomic indicators. The article also mentions several cheap banks in emerging markets and the UK, such as Halyk Bank, Bancolombia, Postal Savings Bank of China, Lloyds Bank, and Banco de Brasil."

Milano has been working in the financial markets for over 15 years and decided to focus on deep value, long-term, and concentrated investing. He launched Quercus Fund with a fee structure similar to Warren Buffett's partnerships in the 50s and 60s, with zero management fees and performance fees only above a certain threshold. Milano's ideal investment is an extremely undervalued business with a healthy balance sheet, poised for a significant increase in earnings and with a long runway for reinvestment. However, he acknowledges that clear investment cases are rarely extremely undervalued and there are usually issues that cloud the future and justify the undervaluation. The most important requirement for Milano is a large discrepancy between the price and conservatively appraised value of the investment."

After being captured and imprisoned, Holker escaped and eventually became an industrial spymaster for the French government. His main task was to steal British textile technologies, as Britain was already at the forefront of European technological development in many industries, including textiles, before the Industrial Revolution. Holker set up a network of agents in England and enticed skilled workers to come to France, where he ensured their skills were spread to French workers. The French government provided financial incentives and subsidies to promote the adoption of British techniques. Holker's efforts were successful, and he was promoted to Inspector-General of Manufactures. His son, John Holker Jr., followed in his footsteps as an industrial spy. Holker's career highlights his talent for espionage and his contribution to the transfer of technology between countries during this period."

The ISA stage involves the fundamental \"language\" that a semiconductor chip uses, with two dominant ISAs being Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) and Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC). Chip Design involves designing the chip itself, with companies like Apple, Google, and Intel playing a role in this stage. Fabrication is the manufacturing stage, with TSMC, Samsung, and Intel being the major players. Equipment & Software refers to the machines and technology used in the fabrication process, with ASML being the only company capable of producing the necessary equipment. Finally, Packaging & Testing involves packaging the chip and testing it for defects before it is shipped out. This subsector is highly fragmented. The article highlights the strategic importance of the semiconductor sector and how it has become a geopolitical chess piece."

        "summary": "The article discusses two main topics. Firstly, it mentions the compression of the spread between the market's earnings yield and 10-year Treasury bonds due to cautious corporate earnings and rising bond yields. This raises the question of whether stocks or bonds are mispriced. The article suggests that stocks may be the problem and predicts a potential decline in stock prices if bond yields continue to rise. Secondly, the article discusses the potential escalation of conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. It mentions the possibility of Israel launching a ground campaign and the potential for increased attacks from Hezbollah and Iran. The article highlights the impact this conflict could have on oil prices, which have already been rising. It concludes by stating that the US is trying to avoid further involvement in the conflict, but Iran and Russia may have an interest in escalating it."

The author highlights the parallels in terms of the exponential growth in demand and the belief in scaling to larger networks or neural networks. They also note the high capital intensity of both industries. However, the author emphasizes that there are significant differences, such as the lower leverage in the AI industry compared to the telecom bubble, the lower barrier to entry in AI, and the current rate hike cycle that has prevented excessive speculation. The author also discusses the importance of supply reacting to demand and how supply in the AI industry is likely to eventually overshoot demand. Overall, the article provides insights into the potential risks and dynamics of the current AI and infrastructure boom."

        "summary": "Momentum is building towards the development of a nasal COVID-19 vaccine, with promising results from early clinical trials and new funding awards. The rationale for a nasal vaccine is based on the need for population-wide respiratory mucosal immunity to combat the evolving virus and its variants. Experimental studies have shown that nasal vaccines can provide tissue-level mucosal immunity, which is lacking in intramuscular vaccines. Nasal vaccines have been found to induce strong mucosal immunity, lower viral loads, and reduce disease and fatality. They also have the potential to provide variant-proof protection. Two companies, Castlevax and Codagenix, have recently announced the results of their Phase 1 human trials for nasal vaccines and have received funding from the US government to accelerate clinical development. Additionally, researchers at Ohio State University have developed a triple intranasal vaccine against measles, mumps, and COVID-19, which has shown a potent immune response in animal models. While there is still a need for further clinical trials, the development of a safe and effective nasal vaccine could provide durable protection against COVID-19 and help in the fight against the ongoing pandemic."

Shareholders want to maximize the valuation of shares, but this carries risks in the long run. Opening for trading below the offering price can be embarrassing and demoralizing. To navigate this, current owners should disclose as much as possible about the business without compromising its competitive position. Warren Buffett's approach to issuing Class B shares in 1996 serves as an example. The players involved in the IPO process have different perspectives based on their incentives. Owners participating in the offering want top dollar, while those planning to exit soon also prefer a high valuation. Owners planning to hold their interest indefinitely want a price that compensates for dilution. The composition of the board of directors determines the dominant owner constituency. Short-term oriented owners may use aggressive accounting methods and non-GAAP metrics to present the business in the best light. Long-term oriented owners prefer candid disclosures. Executive management should have significant stock ownership and stock-based compensation with a multi-year vesting period."

Dollar General also provided updated guidance for its fiscal year, with same-store sales expected to decline by 1% to 0% and diluted earnings per share expected to range from $7.10 to $7.60. The firing of Owen suggests that the board believes the company's problems are company-specific rather than macroeconomic.

        "summary": "Early-stage startup funding in Southeast Asia is experiencing a mini boom, with seed and Series A stage activity increasing year-on-year. While later stage deals have declined, there is a growing interest in pre-seed investments, with larger VC firms in the region starting to invest in the bottom of the value chain. The global economic slowdown and the difficulty of landing big investments have pushed fund managers to flock to early-stage deals. Pre-seed investments offer the opportunity for accelerators and angels to pick up stakes in promising startups at low valuations. The failure rate is high for these early investments, but fund managers only need one or two successful startups to generate significant returns. The emergence of more early-stage funding and mentorship resources, managed by senior operators and founders, may change the way accelerators and incubation programs operate in the region. Overall, the increase in early-stage capital is positive for Southeast Asia's startup ecosystem during the current funding winter."

The Myanmar junta bombed a refugee camp, Laos is exploring special economic zones, and Vietnam is accused of hacking phones in the US. In Thailand, there is ongoing debate about the ease of acquiring modified blank guns, following a shooting incident in a mall. Three people have been arrested for selling the gun and ammunition used in the shooting. The province of Yala, which is involved in a Muslim insurgency, is mentioned in connection with the use of blank guns. Gun culture in Thailand is pervasive, and the government's failure to introduce meaningful reform is highlighted. The article also mentions a government scheme that allows civil servants to buy tax-free guns, which has led to an abundance of weapons circulating among civilians. In relation to the shooting incident, the lawyer representing the family of one of the victims wants the police to investigate the suspect's friends, as there is evidence suggesting admiration for the shooting."

The UNHCR is urging the international community to make big pledges in support of the Rohingya refugees and to provide open policies for host countries. Meanwhile, three signatories have ditched an event hosted by the military in Myanmar, marking the eight-year anniversary of a cease-fire between armed ethnic groups and the military. Junta leader Min Aung Hlaing has not been invited to the Belt and Road Initiative Forum in Beijing, which is seen as a blow to the regime's legitimacy abroad."

In another article, despite the biggest bond losses ever, the financial system remains robust.

The white paper highlights the need for cooperation, openness, and inclusiveness in global development. It also criticizes certain countries for practicing unilateralism, protectionism, and hegemonism, which threaten economic globalization.

Aid groups are calling for more international assistance as civilians suffer the most. In Ecuador, a presidential run-off election is taking place amidst a backdrop of violence and a rising crime problem.

        "summary": "In the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, there are conflicting claims about a blast at a hospital in Gaza that reportedly killed hundreds of people. The Gaza health ministry blames an Israeli air strike, while Israel claims a misfired rocket by the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad is to blame. Independent verification by trusted media outlets with expertise in Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is crucial in determining the truth. In Sudan's Darfur region, at least 68 villages have been set on fire in the past six months, indicating ethnic cleansing, according to evidence based on satellite imagery, social media data, and Nasa heat-recognition technology. Uganda vows to hunt down those responsible for killing a safari guide and a honeymooning couple from the UK and South Africa in a national park. The ISIS-linked Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) armed group is blamed for the attack, with ISIS claiming responsibility. The ADF is a Ugandan group that operates in the deep bush of neighboring Congo and has increased its attacks in recent months."

        "summary": "Academic research has shown that only 4% of stocks listed in the US market outperformed the value-weighted market index, with the top 1,000 companies accounting for all wealth creation. A study using large language models found that the GPT 3.5 model successfully identified corporate risks from earnings call transcripts, with higher risk exposure associated with higher market returns. JP Morgan's report on business failures revealed that most failures were outside of management's control, and concentration was found to be both an engine of wealth creation and a potential destroyer of wealth. Research on corporate insider trading found that all insider transactions generated significant abnormal returns, with outlier transactions having higher returns. These findings suggest that corporate insiders exploit their access to non-public information for an unfair advantage in the market."

        "summary": "Jeff Skilling, the former CEO of Enron, was convicted of conspiracy, insider trading, and securities fraud during the Enron scandal. Skilling and other executives at Enron artificially inflated revenues and hid losses through accounting and corporate fraud. Skilling sold millions of shares before the company's collapse, pocketing millions of dollars. Insider trading by company executives is not uncommon, accounting for 4% of the SEC's actions in 2021. Recent examples include the CEO of Silicon Valley Bank selling shares before the bank collapsed and the Pfizer CEO selling stock on the day the company announced success in clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine. Studies suggest that corporate insiders exploit their access to non-public information for unfair market advantage, and the profits generated from insider trading are statistically significant. Detecting illegal insider trading is challenging, but researchers have developed methods to identify potential trading on non-public information. The SEC requires company insiders to report changes in their holdings, and this data is publicly available. Researchers have used time stamps from audit letters to identify if insiders traded on non-public information. Their findings have been presented to the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board."

        "summary": "The FDA has issued Marketing Denial Orders on six menthol and other flavored variants of British American Tobacco's (BAT) Vuse Alto, causing BAT's American Depository Receipts to fall by 4.8%. However, the bans were not a surprise and BAT is challenging them in court, with a good chance of receiving a stay on their implementation. Previous FDA bans have been overturned, and even if the bans were to take effect, Vuse has demonstrated 100% volume retention in a similar ban in California. The key risk remains the FDA's plan to ban menthol cigarettes, which account for 60% of BAT's US cigarette sales. However, previous menthol bans have shown volume retention of 65%+ in the same category and up to 110% including other categories. BAT's low valuation and leadership in vapor products make it a good investment, and the risk from Philip Morris' IQOS menthol products is limited as they are not expected to have a meaningful impact until after 2025. Overall, BAT's shares have a 6.5x P/E and a 14.7% Free Cash Flow Yield, making them an attractive investment."

        "summary": "Bank of America (BAC) released its Q3 2023 results, reporting stable earnings with a Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) of 15.5%. Deposits, Net Interest Margin, and Net Interest Income (NII) were all relatively flat. While NII is expected to decline modestly, management anticipates it will resume growing in Q3 2024. Investment Banking fees remain below pre-COVID levels, but Sales & Trading revenues have increased. Non-Interest Expenses have continued to decrease, and credit costs for the year are comparable to pre-COVID levels. BAC is already over-capitalized, so the impact of Basel III Endgame rules, which will raise equity capital requirements by 20%, will be less significant. With a Price/Tangible Book Value of 1.15x, BAC shares have a normalized P/E of 8.5x. The dividend yield is 3.5%, and forecasts indicate a total return of 91% by the end of 2026. The investment case for BAC is based on its ability to maintain a low-teens long-term ROTCE on a growing capital base."

However, this pattern needs confirmation. Second, sentiment is becoming bearish, which is interesting considering the upcoming seasonal upshift in flows. Third, stocks appear stretched compared to bonds in terms of price and value. Fourth, equity market valuations are behaving unusually, raising questions about whether this time is different. Fifth, gold miners are cheaper than energy stocks. Overall, there are important \"lines in the sand\" forming for markets, with bullish evidence for the short-term outlook, but risks are also building up. Additionally, the Consensus Inc sentiment indicator dropping below 50% suggests that historically, this has favored the bulls. The seasonal pattern of fund flows indicates that November is typically a strong month. Defensive stocks have been hit hard, potentially signaling a contrarian opportunity. Stocks have had a remarkable run compared to corporate bonds since 2009, but they are now overbought at resistance. Stocks are also expensive compared to bonds and history, while bonds are relatively cheap. Lastly, microcap returns are experiencing drawdowns similar to 2020 levels, except for big tech."

Investment-grade corporate bonds have also seen significant drawdowns due to rising interest rates. However, fund managers and strategists expect longer-term bond yields to be lower next year. The ZEW survey respondents and a majority of fund managers surveyed believe that bond yields will be lower in the future. The correlation between the copper vs gold ratio and US 10-year bond yields seems to be suffering due to the pandemic's supply and stimulus shocks. Another infirm correlation is between US 10-year yields and developed market manufacturing PMIs. The search for yield theme has reversed, with cash providing greater yield than traditional yield-oriented assets. The question arises whether higher interest rates can be the cure for higher interest rates, considering the impact on valuations in real estate and equity markets."

Startup costs have significantly decreased due to SaaS tools, cloud services, and new distribution platforms, allowing founders to build products with as little as $50-100k. This shift in startup costs has implications for the VC industry, with a move towards bootstrapping and profitability becoming more popular. The VC industry is expected to become more barbell-shaped, with big funds on one end and small, specialized funds on the other. The middle ground will struggle to survive. The restructuring of the VC industry will also lead to a consolidation into three distinct segments: traditional artisanal approach, specialization in B2B SaaS startups, and a shift towards private equity-like investments. Small funds are expected to thrive in this new landscape. The dilution of seed investors' returns in later funding rounds highlights the importance of building a profitable business early on. Overall, this is an exciting time for startups and venture capital as a new Renaissance emerges in Silicon Valley."

The analysis reveals that several important trends have been broken, indicating potential weakness in the US economy. The author attributes this to the rapid rise in US long-term Treasury yields, which is causing liquidity to be drawn out of asset markets. They suggest that this shift in the bond market could lead to a self-reinforcing downward spiral in both financial markets and the real economy. The author remains cautious and recommends holding interest-paying cash and buying puts on any equity rally until a significant low is reached.

        "summary": "US real rates have reached their highest level in 15 years, and understanding why is crucial for those following the economy and capital markets. Real rates are the yield paid on government bonds after inflation is deducted. Currently, the US is experiencing both strong economic growth and a high government budget deficit, leading to an increase in Treasury bond issuance. The main drivers of real rates are economic growth, which is influenced by an expanding labor force and improving productivity. Demographics pose a headwind for real growth, as the long-term trend is down, but there is still a large reservoir of employable people outside the labor force. Productivity is typically low during inflationary periods, but the potential impact of AI could provide a boost from 2025 onwards. The high levels of private sector debt following the Great Financial Crisis drove real rates below zero, but currently, large parts of the US economy have no leverage issue. Overall, the current economic context suggests that real rates are too high, and a significant downside move in equities may be on the horizon."

Despite the clear edge in the game, few players were able to maximize their winnings. Haghani found that players often over-bet, under-bet, and bet on tails, indicating a lack of understanding of position sizing. Position sizing is critical in portfolio management, as correctly sizing picks is more important than identifying good investments. Haghani's experiment highlights the importance of understanding risk and position sizing in finance and gambling. Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of crypto exchange FTX, also had a skewed risk perception, as he believed in going big even if it meant a high chance of going bust. However, this approach is not sustainable in the long run. Bankman-Fried's miscalibrated risk engine led him astray, and his risk preferences made it likely that he would go bust quickly. Overall, understanding risk and position sizing is crucial for success in finance and gambling."

Built in 1916, it initially attracted tenants easily but changed ownership multiple times. In 2022, the current owner, RXR Realty, stopped making loan payments to Aareal Bank and went into default. The bank has hired Jones Lang LaSalle to sell the loan at a discount, offering investors an opportunity for capital appreciation. The building's occupancy has dropped to 58% due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and attempts to attract tenants with discounted rents have been unsuccessful. Repurposing the building for residential use would lower its value significantly. Aareal Bank, with its experience in the real estate industry, has increased its loan loss provisions to absorb the financial hit from 61 Broadway. The bank remains optimistic, recognizing the cyclical nature of the real estate business."

The COVID-19 pandemic initially benefited the company as people stocked up on essential items and purchased furniture while in quarantine. However, the company's financial situation has worsened, with declining sales, increased SG&A expenses, and decreasing gross margins due to higher freight costs and inflationary pressures. Despite efforts to improve its balance sheet in FY'20, the company's total debt has skyrocketed to $504.4 million by the end of 2Q'23. To address its liquidity issues, Big Lots has engaged in sale-leaseback transactions, with the latest involving its distribution center in California and 22 store locations, generating net proceeds of approximately $294 million. The company plans to use the proceeds to pay off its debt. However, with limited remaining owned stores and distribution centers, the company may need to explore other options, such as operational improvements or equity dilution, to secure liquidity."

The series features a unique animation style and focuses more on character drama than fight choreography. Despite the challenges of getting the show made, the creators were able to make exactly what they wanted with the support of their partners. Scavengers Reign is set to premiere on October 19. In other animation news, a Russian film called Fairytale, an experimental collage work by Alexander Sokurov, has been denied a distribution certificate in Russia, highlighting the increasing censorship and suppression of art in the country."

A former LifeStance employee raised similar concerns about erroneous billing and scheduling visits that were not made.

        "summary": "Private equity firm Blackstone has seen continued growth in assets under management (AUM), leading some to consider it a good investment. However, the theory that rising interest rates would negatively impact private equity seems to be playing out, as publicly reported commitments to private equity have fallen significantly. Despite this, Blackstone recently closed a $30 billion fund, suggesting a lag in money flows. It is important to note that there is a difference between total AUM and fee-earning AUM, with real estate being a significant portion of the latter. Blackstone has been aggressively pursuing the acquisition of listed real estate investment trusts (REITs) and making them private, allowing them to charge performance fees. However, the performance of listed apartment REITs and slowing flows to the private equity sector may put financial pressure on Blackstone's permanent capital structures. Despite rising interest rates, the stability of collateral values, such as rising US house prices, has helped support Blackstone's AUM. However, a short position on Blackstone may be advisable if inflation and interest rates continue to rise or collateral values start to fall."

This leads to a bullish outlook on wages and real assets, and a bearish outlook on financial assets. The author suggests going long on gold (GLD) and short on long-dated treasuries (TLT) as a way to express this view. The author also suggests going long on high-yield bonds (HYG) and short on TLT for those who don't like the negative carry of the GLD/TLT idea. In a pro-labour world, regulations and tariffs are necessary to protect domestic wages, making devaluing the currency unnecessary. This means that foreigners are no longer the main buyers of treasuries, and locals are buying them instead. The author notes that the S&P 500 has held up well against gold, but a short portfolio of bond proxies and businesses that don't work at interest rates above 7% could be profitable."

India's working-age population is expected to rise, offsetting issues with female labor force participation and underemployment. Transsion, a Chinese smartphone maker, is experiencing growth and increased market share in emerging markets, particularly Africa. It is the only top-five smartphone vendor to gain market share in the third quarter. South Korea is projected to become the world's seventh-largest economy by 2040, with a focus on high-tech industries. The EU is pushing for a world-first deal to phase out CO2-emitting fossil fuels at the upcoming COP28 climate summit."

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved Chevron's proposal, but the decision has sparked criticism and accusations of toxic air pollution and cancer risks. The EPA's approval was based on a worst-case scenario assessment that assumed extreme and unrealistic conditions. In reality, the risks associated with Chevron's proposed fuel were found to be minimal. The environmental groups' claims have been debunked, but the damage has already been done, with Chevron facing defamation and a lawsuit. The article highlights the challenges faced by companies in the fossil fuel industry when attempting to address plastic waste and the tactics used by environmentalists to hinder their efforts."

        "summary": "The 118th US Congress has a slim majority, with Republicans holding a razor-thin edge. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted from his position after a motion to remove him was brought by a conservative member and every Democrat voted against him. McCarthy's removal came after House conservatives feared he had cut a side deal with President Biden on Ukraine funding. The war in Ukraine is not going well, and conservative opposition to sending more military assistance is growing. This poses a challenge for the Biden administration as it heads into an election year. The situation in the Middle East, with the assault by Hamas on Israel, further complicates matters. Funding for Ukraine is running dry, and the pressure on the situation is increasing. The Biden administration is considering linking Ukraine funding to aid for Israel in an attempt to increase the chances of Congress approving aid to Kyiv. However, the situation remains fluid, and much depends on how quickly Republicans can settle on a new speaker and how strongly conservatives oppose Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russian President Putin has blamed the US for the violence in Israel and warned of conflict expansion. In the midst of these events, a natural gas pipeline connecting Finland to Estonia has been severely damaged, possibly due to sabotage. The situation raises questions about Putin's intentions and the potential for further escalation."

        "summary": "Uruguay's transition to renewable energy is often hailed as a success story, with the country reportedly running on 98% renewable electricity. However, a closer look reveals that Uruguay still relies on fossil fuels during periods of drought and that hydroelectric dams play a significant role in its renewable energy mix. The country's small population and relatively low GDP per capita also make its situation less applicable to larger, wealthier nations. Additionally, Uruguay's high consumption of beef contributes significantly to its carbon footprint. The article argues that Uruguay's experience highlights the limitations and challenges of achieving a fully renewable electricity grid, including the need for backup power and the environmental impact of large-scale dams. It suggests that the country's story should be viewed with nuance and caution, rather than as a blueprint for other nations."

Originally a military fort, it became a haven for refugees and squatters, eventually growing into a self-contained city with its own economy and social structure. The Walled City was notorious for its cramped living conditions, lack of sanitation, and rampant crime. However, it also had a vibrant community and a unique architectural style, with buildings stacked on top of each other and interconnected by a maze of narrow alleyways. Despite its reputation, the Walled City had a surprisingly low crime rate and a strong sense of community. The demolition of the Walled City was met with mixed reactions, with some residents mourning the loss of their homes and others relieved to escape the squalor. Today, the site of the Walled City has been transformed into a park, but its legacy lives on as a symbol of urban chaos and resilience."

        "summary": "Global debt has reached a record high of $397 trillion in the first half of 2023, according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF). This increase in debt comes despite tightening credit conditions and is a cause for concern as artificially low interest rates are no longer sustainable. Developed nations, including Japan, the US, Britain, and France, accounted for about 80% of the new global debt, while emerging markets such as China, Brazil, and India also saw significant increases. The IIF warns that as interest rates rise and debt levels increase, domestic debt strains will also rise. The US government alone is over $33 trillion in debt, and interest payments on the debt now match national defense spending. The global economy, which has relied on easy money and low interest rates, is now facing the challenge of higher rates that could potentially break the borrow-and-spend economy. The CPI may show a cooling of inflation, but rising prices are still a concern for Americans. Peter Schiff, an economist, argues that the government is not being honest about inflation, and people are struggling with higher costs of living. To protect themselves, Schiff suggests investing in assets such as gold and silver and divesting from the US dollar."

However, this claim is not true, as it fails to consider the military goals and the potential costs of these conflicts. In the case of Israel, the goal is not just to prevent Hamas attacks, but to overwhelmingly defeat the movement and kill or capture its leadership. This could be a costly and difficult task, as Hamas has hidden resources and uses an unmapped tunnel system. Similarly, Ukraine's goal is to drive Russian forces out of occupied territories, but the campaign has resulted in heavy casualties and equipment losses without significant territorial gains. Funding these wars would place a heavy financial burden on the American people, who are already facing economic challenges such as dwindling savings, high inflation, and record-high debt. The current monetary system may create the illusion that the government can solve global problems without raising taxes, but in reality, the cost is borne by the public through inflation."

The US had been focused on building Israel's diplomatic bridges and diverting attention away from the Palestinian cause, but Hamas' actions have brought the issue back to the forefront. The article argues that blaming Iranian support for Hamas misses the point of the deep-rooted Palestinian grievances. China's failure to criticize Hamas has shocked the West, but other parts of the world may have a better understanding of the conflict's history.

The conflict is the deadliest and most sophisticated since the Yom Kippur War 50 years ago and is shaking the entire Middle East. It is also impacting the Biden administration's plans to counter Chinese and Russian influence in the region. The US has been a key supporter of Israel, providing annual aid of $3.3 billion, making it the largest recipient of US aid since World War II. However, this aid is now causing condemnation of both Washington and Jerusalem in Middle Eastern capitals. The recent diplomatic forays of China and Russia into the region, particularly their success in normalizing Iran-Saudi and Saudi-Syria ties, have prompted the US to seek normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel through the Abraham Accords. However, the Saudis have been difficult to bargain with, and the conflict between Hamas and Israel has further complicated the situation. The conflict is also benefiting Iran, as it pushes Saudi Arabia away from normalization. If the war continues and results in heavy casualties among Palestinians, it will shelve the Saudi-Israel deal and affect Washington's plans to reshape the Middle East."

        "summary": "The Constitutional Court of Indonesia has made a decision allowing presidential and vice presidential candidates under the age of 40 to run in the upcoming general election. This decision is seen as a signal that President Joko Widodo's oldest son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, will be a running mate, potentially establishing a family dynasty. The relationship between President Widodo and his party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP), is unclear following his support for Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto, who ran against Widodo in previous elections. The court's decision has been criticized for favoring Gibran and is seen as an indication of political interests influencing election regulations. With the approaching registration period for the general election, tensions are rising, and there are reports of a breakdown in relations between Widodo and the PDIP. Analysts believe that Widodo's support for Prabowo is aimed at securing his political future and protecting his legacy. If rumors of Gibran accompanying Prabowo come true, the PDIP is expected to double its efforts to defeat them in the election."

However, there are conflicting reports on whether Australia is actively pursuing membership or if it is simply exploring the idea. If Australia were to join ASEAN, it would have implications for both Australia and the ASEAN member countries, as it would alter the balance of power and potentially bring about new opportunities for cooperation and collaboration."

        "summary": "China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has gained momentum and global support, contrasting with the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. The BRI forum, attended by representatives from 130 countries, has showcased China's alternative approach to conflict resolution and economic development. China has made crucial modifications to the BRI, shifting its focus towards services and the digital world. This includes an emphasis on e-commerce, investment protection treaties, standardized trade rules, and green development. The rebranding of the BRI aims to address Western criticism and present China as a responsible economic player. China's openness to foreign investment and removal of restrictions further positions it as an attractive partner for global corporations and governments. In contrast, Washington-supported plans like the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) pale in comparison to the renewed BRI. Ongoing conflicts and Washington's uncritical support for Israel may also impact the viability of these plans. China's revival of the BRI comes at an opportune time for Beijing, while posing challenges for Washington."

        "summary": "China is expected to tighten its funding for Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects in the coming years, despite President Xi Jinping's promise to maintain funding at the recent Belt and Road Forum. Analysts predict that China will focus on quality over quantity and prioritize projects that are economically viable and have a positive impact on local communities. This shift in approach is driven by concerns over debt sustainability and the need to address criticism of the BRI's environmental and social impact. China is also likely to increase its scrutiny of potential borrowers and prioritize countries with stable political environments and strong governance. The tightening of funding is expected to affect countries that have already received significant BRI investments, as well as those seeking future funding. However, China will continue to support projects that align with its strategic interests, such as infrastructure development and connectivity initiatives."

        "summary": "Novavax, a small company based in Maryland, has received FDA approval for its updated Covid-19 vaccine. Unlike the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, Novavax's vaccine contains a coronavirus protein that stimulates the immune system. The company has found a way to produce the vaccine using moth cells, allowing for faster manufacturing. The Novavax vaccine has been shown to provide 50% protection against symptomatic disease in fully vaccinated individuals, according to an Italian study. It is available for anyone 12 years and older, including those who have previously received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. Distribution of the vaccine will take time, but it will eventually be available at 13,000 stores. There is some evidence that mixing the Novavax vaccine with an mRNA vaccine may be immunologically better, but more research is needed. Novavax has also been found to have fewer side effects compared to mRNA vaccines."

COVID-19 metrics, including wastewater, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations, are declining, following the usual seasonal trend. Hospitalizations for COVID-19 are lower than in previous years due to population-level immunity. The Omicron variant is expected to drive the winter surge, with the BA.2.86 variant showing a growth advantage and FLiP mutations gaining ground. Influenza levels are very low, with one strain, Yamagata influenza B, going extinct due to COVID-19 measures. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is picking up, particularly in the South, signaling the start of the RSV season. Excess mortality is above pre-pandemic levels. Vaccination rates for COVID-19 and flu are still uncertain, with 2% of the eligible population estimated to have received their fall COVID-19 vaccine. It is recommended to get vaccinated before Halloween and to wear masks when ILI levels reach epidemic levels."

        "summary": "Vicarious trauma, the psychological impact of second-hand exposure to traumatic events, can have long-lasting effects on mental health. The extent of suffering depends on the dose of exposure and socio-demographic factors. Media exposure, especially through social media and television, can worsen the impact of traumatic events. Studies have shown that heavy social media use after such events can lead to an excess mental health service burden. Certain socio-demographic groups, such as those who share a social identity with the victims or have experienced pre-event trauma, are at higher risk of experiencing vicarious trauma. To reduce the impact of vicarious trauma, individuals can turn off auto-play videos on social media, take breaks from social media, pay attention to their emotions, seek social support, talk to someone they trust, find ways to feel useful, and monitor children's exposure to media. It is important to recognize the collective trauma caused by witnessing terrorist attacks and war and to seek support when feeling overwhelmed."

He emphasized the importance of reducing Type 1 errors to improve investment performance and discussed the unique political risks of investing in China. Torres also touched on the underperformance of value investing and emerging markets in the past decade and the challenge of valuing companies with exponential growth potential. He advised investors to stay on the right side of information asymmetries and protect their portfolios from existential risks. Torres emphasized that not all emerging markets are created equal and discussed the importance of screening for stocks in these markets. He also highlighted the need for emerging market investors to have English accounts and to be comfortable with International Financial Reporting Standards. Overall, Torres provided valuable insights and advice for investors looking to navigate the complexities of value investing in emerging markets."

The fund operates by taking a portion of the newsletter's proceeds and directly giving it to dads in need. However, the process has faced challenges, including difficulties in raising awareness and reaching out to dads who require support. Additionally, the complexity of the US medical system has posed obstacles in finding therapists who can work with US-based clients. Despite these challenges, the therapy fund has already raised a significant amount of money and has helped more dads this year compared to the previous year. The New Fatherhood encourages readers to contribute to the fund by becoming paid subscribers, with their subscription fees going towards helping dads in need."

However, there is a need to find an alternative to real estate, as it accounts for a significant portion of annual economic activity. Constraints such as affordability and leverage prevent real estate from becoming too hot, as it could lead to a major economic and social crisis. In China, the real estate market has become the center of the economy, with local governments benefiting from land sales and families investing in apartments. However, the reliance on real estate has led to a conundrum, as stopping the process of rising prices would cause tremendous pain throughout the economy. The resolution of this issue is expected to be time-consuming and uncertain. Distressed-debt investors who bought bonds from Evergrande, a Chinese real estate company, are realizing that the restructuring process will be overseen by the government and depend on its future plans for the firm."

However, the travel economy is still recovering, and the future of China's outbound travel remains uncertain. Chinese brands have excelled at marketing to Chinese consumers, operating at a speed that is hard to match. Chinese social media plays a significant role in driving the quest for new travel experiences, with user-generated content trusted more than brand-created content. China's high-speed rail network has become pivotal in trip planning and destination marketing, attracting younger travelers and offering appealing onboard services. China also has a unique take on over-tourism, with some destinations becoming overrun during Golden Week. South East Asian destinations, which heavily rely on Chinese tourists, have had to manage their expectations due to decreased international air capacity and gradual demand. It is important for destinations and travel suppliers to avoid over-emphasizing the three Golden Weeks and instead focus on year-round opportunities."

In terms of managing the short book, Westropp emphasizes the importance of valuation and sets criteria for short positions, such as avoiding companies with a short-borrow rate above 30%. He also highlights IPO hangovers, industry bubbles, pump and dumps, and growth deceleration as areas to look for short opportunities.

The spirits segment has solid pricing power and good returns on capital. The non-alcoholic segment represents a smaller portion of revenue, with the Mio Mio brand being the growth driver. Mio Mio is a mate soft drink that is growing rapidly. The company has reduced its low-margin contract bottling business and is focusing on its owned brands and private labels. Berentzen also has a segment for fresh fruit machines, which has been stable but not impressive in terms of growth. The company also has other smaller segments, such as a museum experience and sales to the tourism industry in Turkey.

The largest competitor, Kopenhagen Fur, is set to liquidate in 2025, potentially allowing Saga Furs to gain market share. Saga Furs generates revenue through commissions charged to farmers and buyers at their auctions, as well as interest income from delayed payments. The company has historically struggled with negative earnings due to low fur prices and fixed costs, but higher sales could unlock operating leverage. The correlation between fur prices and Saga Furs' profit suggests that prices may rise in 2024. The author predicts that Saga Furs could take a significant portion of Kopenhagen Fur's market share and potentially achieve a monopolistic position. The company's clean balance sheet, with ample cash and little debt, and its asset-light business model further support its investment potential. While future earnings and price targets are uncertain, the author believes that buying Saga Furs at a low valuation presents a low-risk opportunity for potential profit."

The company's founders, Michael Kirban and Ira Liran, recognized the untapped potential of the coconut water market in the US in 2003 and established a strong supply chain by partnering with coconut product manufacturers in various countries. Despite facing competition from industry giants like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, Vita Coco has emerged as the category leader in the US, with approximately 50% market share. The company has also expanded its focus to serve private label demand, particularly from Costco, which accounts for about 30% of its sales. However, Vita Coco recently announced the transition of its supply relationship with its largest private label customer, which is believed to be Costco. This development raises concerns about the long-term differentiation of Vita Coco's brand from private label offerings. The financial implications of this transition have not been quantified, but it is estimated to be around $50 million per year. Despite this setback, Vita Coco remains a dominant player in the coconut water market, which has grown to nearly $700 million in annual retail sales in the US."

        "summary": "The article provides an update on the oil and natural gas market. WTI oil has reached the expected base case of $92.10 but is currently experiencing a pullback. Brent oil has broken the downtrend channel and reached a significant resistance level. The outlook for crude oil is consolidation before moving higher. A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that a 10% increase in natural gas prices can lead to a 0.2% increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The article also provides outlooks for natural gas and WTI oil. Natural gas shows signs of a potential rally in the near term, while WTI oil is likely to consolidate and retreat from current levels. The article concludes that the outlook for oil and gas is bullish in the short term, but there are factors that could keep prices rangebound. Natural gas is becoming more attractive, and there is potential for upside in the coming months."

        "summarized_date": "2023-10-20",
        "summary": "Gold and silver prices are at risk of significant declines as real yields break out to new highs. The recent strength in gold was due to US regional bank failures and speculation of a higher China premium to global prices. However, even a partial catch-up with real yields could lead to a decline in precious metals. Silver, in particular, is at risk of a sharp decline as it no longer has a high correlation to gold and has industrial uses. The article suggests that if the gold triangle pattern break is verified, there could be meaningful declines in precious metals. The base case price target for gold is $1,700. For silver, if the bear flag thesis is correct, prices should break below $22.15 and gain momentum, with a price target of $15.25. The article also mentions that gold volatility has recently moved sharply and may need a pause before heading higher. Overall, the divergence between gold and real yields suggests that gold may need to catch up in the future."

        "summary": "The Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board have kept their interest rates unchanged, but the reactions in the bond market have been different. The UK Gilt yield curve has bull steepened, while the US yield curve has bear steepened. The British pound has weakened against the Euro and US Dollar, indicating that market participants are unwinding their positions in rates and currencies. Short positions against Gilts were likely curve trades against European bonds. The market suggests a sharp UK slowdown in the short term as the likely outcome. The US Friday reversal may well create a softening in yield in the short term, but it is likely a pause for yet higher yields. Two out of three key US equity indices confirm an H&S pattern. The Russell 2000 and S&P 500 have broken their H&S patterns, while the Nasdaq 100 is at crucial support. The UK Gilt yields are close to breaking down, especially in the curve's 2- and 5-year parts. The oversold momentum indicators are the only things going for the British Pound (GBP), which is insufficient to call for a sustainable bounce. The sharp move in yields last week should be seen in a near one-year consolidation pattern in 10- and 30-year yields. A bond bid due to an equity selloff is unlikely if the decline is measured and not unruly. A 35-year bond bull market unwinds will never be sideways, nor will it end when most think it has fallen too far and cannot fall much further."

Other issues discussed included the impact of climate change, declining fertility rates, the return of the big state, and financial repression. Chartres concluded that the biggest risk for investors is inflation and financial repression, and recommended being more active, owning real assets, and being anti-fragile to preserve wealth. Ruffer also shared a list of \"lobster pot\" stocks that are easy to get into but hard to get out of, with China being a major factor in many of them."

The article also points out the lack of moral consistency among these leftists, as they support Hamas' actions but refuse to support Ukraine's defense against Russian occupation. The author suggests that the Western leftist movement has fallen to a deep sickness and that their support for the Palestinian cause is driven by opposition to the West rather than genuine concern for human rights. The article concludes by stating that this episode will likely damage the leftist movement's reputation among progressive Americans."

Goldin is recognized as one of the pioneers of the \"credibility revolution\" in empirical economics, which focuses on using natural experiments to test hypotheses. Her research has shown the impact of technological innovations, such as the birth control pill, on women's careers and marriage decisions. Goldin's methodology is broad and eclectic, incorporating theories, cultural norms, politics, and economic history. She has created new data sets and uncovered trends in women's employment, highlighting the complex factors that influence women's economic situation. While progress has been made in reducing gender inequalities, Goldin's research also shows that women still face a tradeoff between child-rearing and careers. She suggests that remote work could be a solution to advancing gender equality by providing more flexibility in the workplace. Goldin's work demonstrates the power of understanding social problems at their functional level and using knowledge to reshape the world."

The author warns that most Americans are not mentally prepared for a US-China war and urges for preparation and anticipation. The article concludes by addressing skepticism about the possibility of a war over Taiwan and emphasizes that if China attacks Taiwan, it will likely attack US bases first."

Techno-optimism can also be active or passive, with active optimism believing that technology will progress and improve human life only if the appropriate actions are taken. The author subscribes to both positive and normative techno-optimism but leans more towards active optimism. They believe that technology expands society's collective set of choices and that humans should be given as much choice as possible. However, they acknowledge that society's choices may not always align with individual choices and that technology can be used for both good and evil.

They emphasize the importance of society using technology responsibly and for the greater good. Finally, the author believes that sustainability is not an enemy of techno-optimism but rather a core part of it, as innovation is necessary to sustain technological society into the future."

It explains how state ownership of property in planned economies leads to resource-constrained shortages, while private ownership in market economies leads to demand-constrained surpluses. The article then discusses the recent reemergence of acute shortages in the global economy, caused by overwhelming demand and supply-side constraints. It highlights the role of monetary policy in addressing these shortages and the need for a balance between tightening policy to harden firms' budget constraints and hoping for supply-side capacity to return. The article also discusses the easing of supply constraints in various sectors, such as advanced manufacturing, energy, and food production, leading to increased output and stabilization of prices. It emphasizes that the stabilization in prices has primarily come from improvements in supply rather than contractions in demand. The article concludes by noting the importance of hardening global budget constraints to end the shortage economy and the need for central banks to prevent runaway price increases."

The author reflects on their recently passed dog, Fiona, and the special bond between humans and dogs. The article concludes by discussing the Department of Justice's lawsuit against eBay for enabling the sale of \"rolling coal\" devices, which pump more diesel into a vehicle's engine to emit sooty black clouds of exhaust. The lawsuit claims that eBay enabled the sale of over 343,000 of these devices, which could result in fines under the Clean Air Act."

However, despite export controls and financial sanctions, Russia has been able to import what it needs for its military from the same countries that are supporting Ukraine. Russia's imports of manufactured goods have rebounded and remained steady, with exports from the EU and other democracies being routed through third countries. The Russian government initially restricted the data it published on imports, but has now resumed publishing monthly data. This is a serious problem as many exports going to Russia are coming from the allied democracies, including sophisticated machine tools necessary for military equipment. Extreme sanctions on Russian oil and gas exports have also proven ineffective, as the Russian government does not pay for anything using oil and gas, but rather relies on the ability to tap into the resources of productive societies through imports. Limiting the revenues from oil and gas exports is not enough to defend Ukraine as long as manufacturers continue to supply the Russian military industry with necessary equipment and components."

However, recent data suggests that the surplus has shrunk to an average of $14 billion per quarter in 2023. Despite the decrease in the surplus, there is still a discrepancy between Russian and non-Russian data, making it difficult to interpret the situation accurately.

However, there is a lack of calls for oil and gas companies to increase capital expenditure, and the decline in New Energies equities suggests slower growth in that sector.

The traditional energy sector is seen as under-appreciated, and there may be value in some New Energies equities in the future.

However, this high multiple is due to the company's low estimated earnings, not its valuation. The P/E multiple is a useful piece of information when combined with a sense of the trajectory of earnings, but it has limitations. It does not determine whether a stock is attractive on its own. Factors such as the growth potential of the business and external influences need to be considered. The P/E multiple is a rule of thumb and should be used as a marker of expectations rather than valuation. It provides a starting point for research, but it's up to the individual investor to determine if the market's expectations are accurate. Low P/E stocks have historically underperformed high P/E stocks, but there is no one right answer in any environment.

        "summary": "The market value of GLP-1 weight loss drugs, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, has surged in recent months, with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly experiencing significant gains in market cap. The impact of these drugs extends beyond the pharmaceutical industry, affecting equity valuations and cash flows. The drugs' potential to create significant weight loss has led to a sell-off in food and beverage manufacturers, as well as alcohol purveyors. Investors are also considering the second- and third-order effects of these drugs, such as the potential increase in retail sales as patients on Ozempic require new wardrobes. The drugs' impact on consumer behavior and the market is significant, particularly considering the importance of \"super consumers\" who drive a large portion of sales for certain industries. However, there are concerns about the long-term effectiveness of GLP-1 drugs and potential side effects. Despite this, there is optimism that GLP-1s could have a transformative effect on society, similar to the birth control pill."

Swijtink also shares insights on how to find a way into supermarket shelves, highlighting the importance of building relationships and not being shy about putting oneself out there. He advises entrepreneurs to be prepared for rejection and constructive feedback, and to figure out how to get the attention of potential buyers. Swijtink also discusses the coffee culture in Vietnam, the difference between Robusta and Arabica beans, and Lac\u00e0ph's relationship with coffee farmers. He concludes by recommending the book \"Power\" by Professor Pfeffer, which explores the concept of power and how to manage it effectively."

They argue that these amendments threaten the safety and national sovereignty of Malaysia. The coalition claims that if the government fails to object before December 1, 2023, it would violate the national constitution and the basic rights of the people. They also highlight that the amendments could potentially take away the power of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (the King) in declaring emergencies, which is a criminal offense under the Penal Code. The coalition points out that other countries, such as Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, have already gathered signatures and made statements objecting to the WHO CA+ and IHR2005 amendments.

Supporters of the 70-year-old economist have organized a \"National Townhall for Justice Roadshow\" to advocate for a royal pardon. However, it is unlikely that Najib can be pardoned unless his other court cases are dismissed. Despite being in jail, Najib remains a powerful political figure and is believed to control a significant amount of political funds. Many fear that without him, Malaysia could fall into the hands of Islamist fundamentalists. However, it is important to remember Najib's involvement in corruption and other crimes. Police found a massive amount of stolen wealth, including jewelry, handbags, and cash, at his residence. He is also accused of ordering the murder of a former lover who knew too much about the 1MDB scandal. If Najib is pardoned, he could potentially regain power and continue his corrupt practices."

It points out that there have been no free elections in Gaza for the past 17 years, and the leaders of Hamas, like Ismail Haniyeh, do not live in Gaza and do not have the mandate of the people. The author questions who made the decision for Hamas to go to war and suggests that they may have received instructions from the Muslim Brotherhood in Qatar or Iran. The article argues that Hamas has no chance of victory against Israel, as Israel has a much larger military and controls essential resources like water, food, and electricity in Gaza. The author speculates that Hamas may have started the war to gain financial support and remind the world of its existence. The article concludes by suggesting that the conflict in the Middle East will continue for decades due to the competing interests of Iran, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states, and criticizes the region's leaders as being \"insane.\""

They have a particularly robust relationship with the Communist regime in Venezuela, where they work together to build transnational organized crime networks. Hezbollah operatives are provided with state-sponsored cover identities and access to Venezuela's airline and banking systems, allowing them to move freely in the Western Hemisphere. The influx of Venezuelans crossing the US southern border provides an opportunity for Hezbollah operatives to infiltrate the country. Hezbollah is known for its long-term planning and stockpiling of explosives, as well as cultivating contacts for firearms. They have also created target packages on potential targets in cities like New York, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. Despite the focus on the Middle East, it is important to recognize that Hezbollah is already present in the United States and poses a significant threat."

The Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) is highlighted as a group at the heart of the growing \"protest\" movement, which has been linked to terror groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The SJP is also connected to the American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), an organization whose leaders include former Islamic terrorists. The article argues that these radical leftist groups, including SJP, are not simply protesting but explicitly calling for violence and destruction in solidarity with Hamas. Law enforcement agencies across the US have gone on alert in response to the rising threat level, with enhanced security measures and increased patrols of Jewish houses of worship, Jewish-owned businesses, and Israeli diplomatic buildings. The article concludes by suggesting that the nation has lost its way, citing examples such as the US President giving billions to the ayatollahs and the President's special envoy to Iran having his security clearance suspended for giving classified information to Iran."

The referendum was overwhelmingly rejected, with only around 40% voting in favor and at least 5 states not carrying the constitutional amendment. Many Indigenous Australians also voted against 'The Voice' due to concerns about representation and the fear that it would be controlled by self-appointed activists. The article highlights the failure of the 'yes' campaign to address these concerns and the labeling of 'no' voters as racist. It also raises questions about the allocation of funds for Indigenous Australians and the lack of transparency and accountability. The article suggests that the defeat of 'The Voice' referendum may set back the cause of Indigenous Australians and calls for further investigation into corruption and the representation of Indigenous Australians. The article concludes by comparing the referendum to the failed 1999 referendum on Australia becoming a republic and warns of potential consequences for the prime minister."

The government debt is expected to surpass RM 1.5 trillion. The budget papers forecasted growth at 4-5 percent, but there may be a tax collection shortfall if there is an economic slowdown. Little has been done to broaden the tax base, and the focus has been on a 10 percent capital gains tax and a tax on luxury goods. The budget includes spending on SME development, flood mitigation, food security, and welfare, similar to previous governments. Civil servants will receive incentives and increased pension payouts, which make up a significant portion of government expenditure. There is no effort to rein in public sector expenditure, raising concerns about productivity. The budget also includes plans for green initiatives, such as the use of solar panels and electric vehicles, but there are questions about the practicality and the need to import these technologies. The budget has faced criticism for using public funds for infrastructure projects and land purchases by government-linked companies. Overall, the budget has been seen as lacking significant changes in policies."

However, bloggers face attacks from wealthy corporations who take advantage of weak libel laws. The marginalized in society are often the only ones who support and appreciate the work of bloggers.

The 'unity government' could provide stability and clarity for Malaysians, but it needs PAS more than PAS needs it.

This could lead to a loss of control over crucial infrastructure if Chinese suppliers become inaccessible. The rest of the world should be wary of becoming dependent on China for these supplies, as it would be difficult and costly to regain manufacturing expertise and capacity if access is lost. In other news, Microsoft is reportedly close to unveiling its Athena AI Accelerator Chip, which it has been developing since 2019. The chip is expected to compete with Nvidia's offerings and could provide benefits for hyperscalers by reducing costs and increasing control over hardware. Nvidia, on the other hand, is attempting to reduce its reliance on hyperscalers by building its own cloud service and leasing data center space. However, regulators' attacks on Big Tech are seen as unsavory, and there is a need for a substantive debate on how to best deal with the power amassed by these companies.

        "summary": "The US government has updated its export controls on AI chips, expanding its authority to determine what products US companies can sell in the name of national security. The updated rules ban shipments of high-end AI chips, including those developed by Nvidia and Intel for the Chinese market, without a license. Even high-end gaming chips are now more closely monitored. Nvidia has stated that the short-term impact on its results won't be significant due to high demand elsewhere, but losing more of the Chinese market in the long term will change the company's addressable market. The updated rules aim to prevent the misuse of chips to undermine US national security."

        "summary": "Dollar Tree shares offer an attractive entry point for investors, with a 3-year target price of $200, according to a report by Value Punks. The report highlights the growth potential of the dollar store industry, which has been steadily taking share in retail for decades. Dollar stores offer a difficult-to-replicate value proposition that is insulated from e-commerce competition. Dollar Tree, in particular, has self-help opportunities to improve sales productivity and operating efficiency. The report also praises the management team, led by Chairman/CEO Rick Dreiling, who has a track record of success in the industry. The market is currently extrapolating recent issues at Dollar General to Dollar Tree, but the report argues that Dollar Tree is contributing to Dollar General's woes and is ahead in its investment cycle. The report concludes that Dollar Tree has an attractive return profile, with a target price range of $190-230/share and a 3-year IRR range of 23-30%."

        "summary": "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) communicates monetary policy through the federal funds rate, which is the rate for short-term lending and borrowing of central bank reserves in the U.S. The market for federal funds has changed since the global financial crisis, with a decrease in daily trading volume. The main borrowers in the fed funds market are the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks (FBO branches), while domestic banks also borrow but at smaller volumes. FBO branches borrow in the fed funds market because they have limited access to deposits and face lower borrowing costs compared to domestic banks. Domestic banks increase their borrowing when aggregate reserves decline. The main lenders in the fed funds market are the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), which lend to their members through collateralized loans. FHLBs hold liquidity portfolios and do not earn interest on their balances at the central bank, creating an incentive for them to lend at rates below the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate. Domestic depository institutions also lend in the fed funds market but at small volumes due to their ability to earn the IORB rate. Overall, the fed funds market has changed significantly since 2008, with the Fed's balance sheet expansion and the introduction of interest on reserve balances."

        "summary": "Household saving rates in the United States and other high-income economies increased during the pandemic due to reduced spending and government income support. However, saving behavior has diverged since then, with the U.S. saving rate dropping below pre-pandemic levels while saving rates in other countries remain above pre-pandemic levels. As a result, U.S. consumers have been spending down their excess savings while excess savings in other countries remain untapped. This divergence helps explain why U.S. GDP has returned to its pre-pandemic trend path while GDP levels in other high-income economies remain below trend. The drawdown in U.S. excess savings has contributed to U.S. GDP growth, while weak consumer spending has acted as a drag on the recoveries of other countries. The reasons for this divergence in saving behavior are unclear, but it may be related to differences in the drivers of excess saving, such as unexpected income windfalls in the U.S. The spending down of excess savings in the U.S. has supported growth despite lagging real income and tighter financial conditions."

        "summary": "Large firms, including both domestic and multinational companies, generate positive total factor productivity (TFP) spillovers to their domestic suppliers, according to a study by Mary Amiti, C\u00e9dric Duprez, Jozef Konings, and John Van Reenen. The study, which used firm-to-firm transaction data for Belgian firms between 2002 and 2014, found that firms that started selling to a \"superstar\" firm experienced around 7 to 8 percent higher TFP than firms that did not have a relationship with a superstar firm. The spillovers were observed for all types of superstar firms, including large firms, multinationals, and exporters. The study also found that forming relationships with superstar firms led to increases in sales, intermediate inputs, labor, capital, and the number of buyers for supplier firms. The spillovers were attributed to factors such as the transfer of know-how, access to new networks of potential customers, and signaling effects. The findings suggest that allowing superstar firms to grow and form relationships with less successful firms can have advantages for the economy."

Black children are 50% more likely to be placed into foster care than white children who have the same potential for experiencing maltreatment if left at home. The study used a quasi-experimental approach to measure unwarranted racial disparities by examining the placement rates of case investigators in Michigan. The findings suggest that racial discrimination may be a factor in the disparities observed. However, it is also important to consider the risk of subsequent maltreatment when assessing the placement disparities. The study found that the disparities were driven by children who had a potential for maltreatment if left at home. The research also suggests that higher placement rates among Black children may offer protection to those at risk of maltreatment. The study highlights the need for policies that aim to reduce racial disparities in foster care placement and improve family well-being."

        "summarized_date": "2023-10-20",
        "summary": "The article discusses the evolution of liquidity in the U.S. Treasury securities market in 2023. The market experienced a worsening of liquidity in March 2023 after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, but quickly improved to levels similar to the previous year. Liquidity in the market is important for various purposes, including financing the U.S. government, managing interest rate risk, and implementing monetary policy. The article examines three commonly used measures of liquidity: bid-ask spread, order book depth, and price impact. These measures indicate that liquidity worsened in March 2023 but returned to levels similar to the previous year within a month. The increase in volatility due to the failures of the banks explains the observed patterns in liquidity. The analysis also shows that liquidity in 2023 is consistent with the historical relationship between liquidity and volatility. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for continued vigilance and efforts to enhance the market's resilience."

        "summary": "Consumer spending in the US has been stronger than expected, with real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) growing faster than predicted. The strength of consumption can be attributed to factors such as the fast rollout of vaccines, larger-than-expected fiscal stimulus, and low interest rates. While there is uncertainty about the level of excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, a broader assessment of households' financial positions is more important than excess savings alone. The role of debt in supporting consumption is examined, with households benefiting from lower mortgage payments and cash-out refinances. Other forms of debt, such as student loans and credit cards, have also contributed to available funds for consumption. Indicators of households' financial health, such as delinquency rates and consumer expectations, suggest that the household sector is in a strong position. However, the end of very low interest rates and the resumption of student loan payments may tighten household finances in the future."

        "summary": "The end of the federal student loan payment pause has led to an analysis of borrower expectations regarding the impact of the payment resumption on future spending growth, credit delinquency, and the economy. The findings suggest that the resumption of payments will have a relatively small overall effect on consumption, with a 0.1 percentage point reduction in aggregate spending from August levels. Student loan delinquency rates are expected to return to pre-pandemic levels. Low-income borrowers, female borrowers, those with less than a bachelor's degree, and those who were not in repayment before the pandemic are more likely to expect missed student loan payments. The survey also reveals that enrollment in income-driven repayment (IDR) plans is expected to increase, particularly among low-income borrowers. Borrowers anticipate a decrease in average monthly spending of around $56 per month when payments resume. The likelihood of missing a student loan payment is higher for female borrowers and those with lower household incomes. However, expectations for missing non-student loan payments are more similar across groups. Overall, the impact of the payment resumption on consumption and delinquency is expected to be relatively modest, partly due to borrowers already adjusting their savings and consumption decisions in anticipation of the resumption."

        "summary": "China is unlikely to achieve its goal of reaching the per capita income of a mid-level developed country by 2035, according to economists Hunter L. Clark and Matthew Higgins. They argue that China's rapid growth is facing challenges such as population aging, diminishing returns to its investment-centered growth model, increased state management of the economy, credit issues in real estate, and limited access to foreign technologies. Even with generous assumptions about future growth, China is projected to close only a fraction of the income gap with high-income countries. The authors also highlight the constraints on China's future growth, including declining labor inputs due to population aging and diminishing returns to capital accumulation. They argue that achieving the necessary productivity growth to meet income goals is unlikely, given that China's productivity growth is already high and historical precedents show that very few countries have achieved such growth rates. Additionally, the authors point out the structural headwinds, such as state management of the economy, institutional development, the need to rebalance the economy, and high levels of private and government debt. The authors conclude that while China has strengths, such as a well-educated population and technological advancements, the odds of achieving the income growth target are stiff."

They argue that buybacks can be unpredictable and may not always increase shareholder value. The author prefers dividends because they provide a steady income and the option to reinvest the cash. They also highlight the importance of a company's history of both dividends and buybacks when analyzing investment opportunities. The article concludes by stating that while a consistent share buyback can be powerful and beneficial for dividend growth, it is not always the best capital allocation choice, and other factors such as reinvestment potential or acquisitions should also be considered."

        "summary": "Investors are continuing to pour money into US Treasuries, despite the fact that they are on track to produce negative returns for three consecutive years. This is atypical behavior, as investors typically flee asset classes that have been performing poorly. The inflow into long-duration Treasury Bond Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) has also been strong. However, if US Treasuries fail to respond to financial market stress, such as a plunge in stock prices, it could be a sign that they are losing their safe-haven status. The inability of US Treasuries to hold a brief price spurt due to recent events in Israel is not encouraging. Despite this, if US Treasuries were to surge to a yield of 6%, triggering a stock market correction, a bond market rally is likely to follow. However, the long-term outlook for US Treasuries remains bearish due to a torrent of supply and a lack of buyers. In the oil market, there has been a deep contraction in the number of Drilled, Uncompleted (DUC) wells, which is rarely discussed. This contraction has created a backlog of partially completed wells, and producers need to increase drilling activity to meet demand. The cautious consumer sentiment and deceleration in spending indicate a potential recession. Despite the current bullish sentiment in the financial media, there is a fear of missing out on the usual October rally."

The winners in this situation would be big tech incumbents, as open AI models erode the profitability of proprietary models. Additionally, charlatan DC lawmakers who are capitalizing on the fear and confusion surrounding China and AI are also benefiting from this push to restrict open source. Ironically, these restrictions would actually benefit China by making its AI capabilities appear stronger than they actually are. Restricting open source would also have negative consequences, such as stifling innovation and collaboration, and wasting the talent and identity of programmers and developers, particularly in China.

Natural gas prices have surged, and Chevron has temporarily halted production at one of its Israeli fields. The IMF has released new forecasts for the global economy, predicting a worsening of global growth, particularly in Europe and China. Inflation is expected to decrease globally, and there are concerns about China's financial stability due to the real estate crisis. The CPI in the US has come out slightly higher than expected, with energy costs decreasing. In Europe, there are some signs of improvement, but growth remains weak, especially in Germany. The upcoming week will provide important economic updates on growth and inflation in various countries. The quarterly reports of US banks have exceeded analysts' expectations, thanks to the strong US economy and rising interest rates."

The program aims to connect writers in local communities and provide them with a dedicated space to share insights, celebrate wins, and support one another. The meetups have been described as having a palpable energy and creating a sense that more is possible. However, finding writers in one's neighborhood or city can be challenging, which is why Substack is calling for writer hosts to organize these gatherings. The program has already seen success in cities like Paris and Los Angeles. The Amsterdam writer meetup, hosted by photographer and curator Wesley Verhoeve, is set to take place on October 18. Verhoeve believes that Amsterdam is uniquely suited for a writer community due to its culture of creating spaces for creative individuals. Substack users can stay updated on upcoming meetups in their cities through the Substack app."

        "summary": "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) communicates monetary policy through the federal funds rate, which is the rate for short-term lending and borrowing of central bank reserves in the U.S. The market for federal funds has changed since the global financial crisis, with a decrease in daily trading volume. The main borrowers in the fed funds market are the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks (FBO branches), while domestic banks also borrow but at smaller volumes. FBO branches borrow in the fed funds market because they have limited access to deposits and face lower borrowing costs compared to domestic banks. Domestic banks borrow more when aggregate reserves decline. The main lenders in the fed funds market are the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), which lend to their members through collateralized loans. FHLBs hold liquidity portfolios and do not earn interest on their balances at the central bank, creating an incentive for them to lend at rates below the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate. Domestic depository institutions also lend in the fed funds market but at small volumes due to their ability to earn the IORB rate."

        "summary": "Household saving rates in the United States and other high-income economies increased during the pandemic due to reduced spending and government income support. However, saving behavior has diverged since then, with the U.S. saving rate dropping below pre-pandemic levels while saving rates in other countries remain above pre-pandemic levels. As a result, U.S. consumers have been spending down their excess savings while foreign consumers have not. This divergence helps explain why U.S. GDP has returned to its pre-pandemic trend path while GDP levels in other high-income economies remain below trend. The drawdown in U.S. excess savings has contributed to the country's economic growth, while weak consumer spending has acted as a drag on the recoveries of foreign economies. The reasons for this divergence in saving behavior are unclear, but it may be related to differences in the drivers of excess saving, such as unexpected income windfalls in the U.S. The spending down of excess savings in the U.S. has supported growth despite lagging real income and tighter financial conditions."

        "summary": "Large firms, including both domestic and multinational companies, generate positive total factor productivity (TFP) spillovers to their domestic suppliers, according to a study by Mary Amiti, C\u00e9dric Duprez, Jozef Konings, and John Van Reenen. The study, which used firm-to-firm transaction data for Belgian firms between 2002 and 2014, found that firms that started selling to a \"superstar\" firm experienced around 7 to 8 percent higher TFP than firms that did not have a relationship with a superstar firm. The spillovers were observed for all types of superstar firms, including large firms, multinationals, and exporters. The study also found that forming relationships with superstar firms led to increases in sales, intermediate inputs, labor, capital, and the number of buyers for supplier firms. The spillovers were attributed to factors such as the transfer of know-how, access to new networks of potential customers, and signaling effects. The findings suggest that allowing superstar firms to grow and form relationships with less successful firms can have advantages for the economy."

Black children are 50% more likely to be placed into foster care than white children who have the same potential for experiencing maltreatment if left at home. The study used a quasi-experimental approach to measure unwarranted racial disparities by examining the placement rates of case investigators in Michigan. The findings suggest that racial discrimination may be a factor in the disparities observed. However, it is also important to consider the risk of subsequent maltreatment when assessing these disparities. The study found that the disparities were driven by children who had a potential for maltreatment if left at home. The research also suggests that higher placement rates among Black children may offer protection to those at risk of maltreatment. The study highlights the need for policies that aim to reduce racial disparities in foster care placement while also improving family well-being."

        "summarized_date": "2023-10-20",
        "summary": "The article discusses the evolution of liquidity in the U.S. Treasury securities market in 2023. The market experienced a worsening of liquidity in March 2023 after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, but quickly improved to levels similar to the previous year. Liquidity in the market is important for various purposes, including financing the U.S. government, managing interest rate risk, and implementing monetary policy. The article examines three commonly used measures of liquidity: bid-ask spread, order book depth, and price impact. These measures indicate that liquidity worsened in March 2023 but returned to levels similar to the previous year within a month. The increase in volatility due to the failures of the banks explains the observed patterns in liquidity. The analysis also shows that liquidity in 2023 is consistent with the historical relationship between liquidity and volatility. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for continued vigilance and efforts to enhance the market's resilience."

        "summary": "Consumer spending in the US has been stronger than expected, with real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) growing faster than predicted. The strength of consumption can be attributed to factors such as the fast rollout of vaccines, larger-than-expected fiscal stimulus, and low interest rates. While there is uncertainty about the level of excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, a broader assessment of households' financial positions is more important than excess savings alone. The role of debt in supporting consumption is examined, with households benefiting from lower mortgage payments and cash-out refinances. Other forms of debt, such as student loans and credit cards, have also contributed to available funds for consumption. Indicators of households' financial health, such as delinquency rates and consumer expectations, suggest that the household sector is in a strong position. However, the end of very low interest rates and the resumption of student loan payments may tighten household finances in the future."

        "summary": "The end of the federal student loan payment pause has led to an analysis of borrower expectations regarding the impact of the payment resumption on future spending growth, credit delinquency, and the economy. The findings suggest that the resumption of payments will have a relatively small overall effect on consumption, with a 0.1 percentage point reduction in aggregate spending from August levels. Student loan delinquency rates are expected to return to pre-pandemic levels. Low-income borrowers, female borrowers, those with less than a bachelor's degree, and those who were not in repayment before the pandemic are more likely to expect missed student loan payments. The survey also revealed that enrollment in income-driven repayment (IDR) plans is expected to increase, particularly among low-income borrowers. Borrowers anticipate a decrease in average monthly spending of around $56 per month when payments resume. The likelihood of missing a student loan payment is higher for female borrowers and those with lower household incomes. However, expectations for missing non-student loan payments are more similar across groups. Overall, the impact of the payment resumption on consumption and delinquency is expected to be relatively modest, partly due to borrowers already adjusting their savings and consumption decisions in anticipation of the resumption."

        "summary": "China is unlikely to achieve its goal of reaching the per capita income of a mid-level developed country by 2035, according to economists Hunter L. Clark and Matthew Higgins. They argue that China's rapid growth is facing challenges such as population aging, diminishing returns to its investment-centered growth model, increased state management of the economy, credit issues in real estate, and limited access to foreign technologies. Even with generous assumptions about future growth, China is projected to close only a fraction of the income gap with high-income countries. The authors also highlight the constraints on China's future growth, including declining labor inputs due to population aging and diminishing returns to capital accumulation. They argue that achieving the necessary productivity growth to meet income goals is unlikely, given that China's productivity growth is already high and historical precedents show that very few countries have achieved such growth rates. Additionally, the authors point out the structural headwinds, such as state management of the economy, institutional development, the need to rebalance the economy, and high levels of private and government debt. The authors conclude that while China has strengths, such as a well-educated population and technological advancements, the odds of achieving the income growth target are stiff."

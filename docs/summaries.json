The author argues that the Republican Party has become an extreme-right party, comparable to Fidesz in Hungary, while the Democratic Party remains a moderate party of the center and center-left. The author criticizes an article by Yglesias titled \"Polarization is a choice,\" stating that it promotes a false equivalence between the two parties. The author asserts that the polarization in American politics is primarily driven by the radicalization of the Republican Party, fueled by interactions between Republican voters and right-wing media. The author concludes that the analysis of the US political scene as a contest between two normal political parties is fundamentally flawed, and that the intention to establish a permanent right-wing dictatorship is evident in certain projects."

        "summary": "China's household balance sheets have been damaged by a prolonged borrowing binge, COVID-19 impacts, and a slump in the property market. As a result, consumer sentiment and confidence in future income gains are at record lows. The collapse of the property market has also led to a decline in residential investment spending and a decrease in property sales. Chinese households have responded by paying down their mortgage debt and increasing their savings deposits, indicating a shift towards risk aversion. However, these actions have contributed to a decline in consumer borrowing and slowed consumer credit growth. The Chinese government's efforts to revive demand for new homes have been unsuccessful, and policymakers face the challenge of reversing households' pessimistic attitudes to boost consumption and economic growth."

        "summary": "A study conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has found that \"buy now, pay later\" (BNPL) services are being used by a wide range of consumers, but there are concerns about the potential risks associated with these payment plans. The study found that while BNPL can expand financial inclusion, especially for those with low credit scores, it also disproportionately attracts consumers with unmet credit needs and limited credit access. These users are more financially fragile and have a higher likelihood of accumulating excessive debt. The study also highlighted that BNPL loans may not benefit unbanked consumers or those who are \"credit invisible.\" Additionally, there are concerns that BNPL may enable consumers to spend more than they otherwise would, leading to overextension and financial stress. The study calls for more data and analysis to fully understand the risks and benefits of BNPL and its impact on consumers' financial well-being."

        "summary": "The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has updated its economic forecasts using its dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. The model predicts that the economy will remain resilient despite the tightening of monetary policy. Output growth is projected to be higher than previously forecasted, with a lower probability of a recession. Inflation projections remain close to previous forecasts, and the model expects inflation to return to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) goal by the end of next year. The forecast also shows that the output gap will be higher than previously estimated, indicating that the strength of the economy is driven by demand factors rather than supply factors. The real natural rate of interest is expected to decline over the forecast horizon. The article includes tables and charts that provide a visual representation of the forecasts. It is important to note that the DSGE model forecast is not an official forecast of the New York Fed, but rather an input to the Research staff's overall forecasting process."

Visiativ, a French company, has announced a new strategic plan to achieve \u20ac500 million in sales by 2028, with 50% coming from international markets. The company's H1 2023 results showed increased expenses due to brand unification efforts. Sales teams' incentives have been changed to align with the transition to a SAAS model. Visiativ has implemented an employee shareholding plan, bringing their stake up to 6.37%. The company is pursuing external growth through resellers/integrators of Dassault Syst\u00e8mes solutions, consulting, and software editing. Visiativ uses factoring to finance working capital and neutralize seasonality. They immobilize some R&D to demonstrate innovation. While Visiativ currently relies on Dassault Syst\u00e8mes products for 50% of their sales, they aim to decrease this percentage over time. The author expresses hesitation in investing in Visiativ due to their dependency on an outside product. The company has started paying dividends since 2021, potentially due to financial leverage from the Alliativ holding."

        "guid": "https://www.thelastbearstanding.com/p/the-trouble-with-charles-schwab",
        "summary": "Charles Schwab's financial position has weakened, with a 44% decline in bank deposits over the past five quarters and substantial unrealized losses on its security portfolio. Its Tangible Common Equity capital is at just 1.8% of total assets, and it likely has negative tangible equity value. The company's future depends on customer decisions, monetary policy, regulatory action, and how it navigates these challenges. Charles Schwab Bank, the company's primary bank, has seen a significant decline in deposits due to rising interest rates. The company has drawn down its cash balance, reduced its securities portfolio, increased short-term borrowings, and brokered high-cost Certificates of Deposit to manage the cash outflow. While the company has access to substantial liquidity, any further borrowing or brokered deposits would be dilutive to net interest margins and capital balances. The decline in deposits has also impaired the value of the company's assets, resulting in unrealized losses and a decline in equity capital. The company's equity measures have deteriorated, but its Common Equity Tier 1 regulatory capital remains relatively constant due to the exclusion of unrealized losses. However, new regulations may change this treatment. If the regulatory change is implemented, it will be a headwind to Schwab's earnings and balance-sheet flexibility. The company may have negative tangible equity capital on a fair-market-value basis, but its reported regulatory capital ratios and Tangible Common Equity will remain positive."

        "guid": "https://www.thelastbearstanding.com/p/higher-for-a-little-bit-longer",
        "summary": "The Federal Reserve's long-run estimate of 2.5% for interest rates has remained unchanged since 2020, despite aggressive rate hikes in the short-term. This static estimate may be driven by factors such as credibility concerns and a preference for tackling inflation at the front end of the yield curve. The Fed's policy of raising short-term rates while maintaining a static long-run estimate softens the impact of rate hikes and allows borrowers to lock in debt at advantageous long-term fixed rates. However, the Fed has been forced to push up its dot plot for the next several years, leading to higher long-term interest rates. The recent FOMC meeting saw the Fed removing two rate cuts from its projections for 2024, effectively raising its rate guidance for 2024 and 2025. This adjustment in guidance has put incremental pressure on the long-end of the yield curve, with the entire U.S. Treasury yield curve currently sitting at cycle highs. The rationale for this increase may be stronger GDP growth projections or a gradual shift in the Fed's opinion on the neutral rate in a post-COVID economy."

        "summary": "The upcoming executive order on AI from the White House may require cloud computing platforms to share customer information with regulators, according to a report by Semafor. This approach, similar to a \"know your customer\" scheme, aims to prevent bad actors and foreign adversaries from accessing AI computing power. The regulation would be applied to well-established cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle, and IBM, which already have experience in regulatory compliance due to their work with financial institutions. Requiring cloud platforms to share customer information with regulators could also benefit AI startups by relieving them of the compliance burden. However, there are potential drawbacks to this approach, such as the difficulty of drawing a compute threshold and the possibility of regulatory capture, where incumbents benefit from increased regulation. Overall, the author believes that some level of regulation is necessary for AI, and requiring transparency from cloud platforms and treating them like banks is a reasonable approach."

However, despite this potential catalyst, the yen has not experienced a significant price surge. The article includes charts showing the exchange rate between the yen and the dollar over the past decade.

The death of the 60/40 equity/bond portfolio is also being questioned, as few investors actually hold portfolios that adhere to this allocation. The trend towards passive investment and systematic portfolio rebalancing is contributing to market inefficiency, as fixed weight rebalancing strategies lack a self-correcting mechanism. While it is uncertain when a correction in mispricing will occur, it is likely to be qualitative rather than quantitative. The current bond/equity mispricing resembles the persistent undervaluation of value stocks, and there is a fear that it may persist longer than anticipated."

The article discusses the historical trend of declining real interest rates and argues that recent increases in interest rates are temporary and driven by central bank policies rather than inflationary pressures. It highlights the growing risk of refinancing, particularly in the high-yield sector, and warns of potential financial vulnerability if interest rates remain high. The author also discusses the long-term trend of lower real interest rates and attributes it to factors such as population pressures and surplus resources. The article concludes by noting that the current rise in interest rates is due to central bank actions and emphasizes the unprecedented speed and magnitude of this interest rate hiking cycle."

        "summary": "China's household balance sheets have been damaged by a prolonged borrowing binge, COVID-19 impacts, and a slump in the property market. As a result, consumer sentiment and confidence in future income gains are at record lows. The collapse of the property market has also led to a decline in residential investment spending and a decrease in property sales. Chinese households have responded by paying down their mortgage debt and increasing their savings deposits, indicating a shift towards risk aversion. However, these actions have contributed to a decline in consumer borrowing and slowed consumer credit growth. The Chinese government's efforts to revive demand for new homes have been unsuccessful, and policymakers face the challenge of reversing households' pessimistic attitudes to boost consumption and economic growth."

        "summary": "A study conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has found that \"buy now, pay later\" (BNPL) services are being used by a wide range of consumers, but there are concerns about the potential risks associated with these payment plans. The study found that while BNPL can expand financial inclusion, especially for those with low credit scores, it also disproportionately attracts consumers with unmet credit needs and greater financial fragility. The research revealed that BNPL users are more financially fragile and less likely to rely on savings in case of an emergency. Additionally, there is evidence that BNPL may enable consumers to spend and borrow more than they otherwise would. The study highlights the need for more data and analysis to assess the extent to which BNPL borrowing contributes to financial stress and overall financial well-being. The findings suggest that while BNPL services have benefits, there are risks associated with excessive debt accumulation and over-extension."

        "summary": "The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has updated its economic forecasts using its dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. The model predicts that the economy will remain resilient despite the tightening of monetary policy. Output growth is projected to be higher than previously forecasted, with a lower probability of a recession. Inflation projections remain close to previous forecasts, and the model expects inflation to return to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) goal by the end of next year. The forecast also shows that the output gap will be higher than previously estimated, indicating that the strength of the economy is driven by demand factors rather than supply factors. The real natural rate of interest is expected to decline over the forecast horizon. The article includes tables and charts that provide a visual representation of the forecasts. It is important to note that the DSGE model forecast is not an official forecast of the New York Fed, but rather an input to the Research staff's overall forecasting process."

        "summary": "Zebra Technologies, a high-quality industrial company, is currently experiencing a downturn due to disappointing Q2 numbers and reduced full-year guidance. The decline is attributed to the normalization of pandemic-level demand, particularly in the retail and logistics sectors. Additionally, Zebra faced a significant litigation settlement payment to competitor Honeywell, impacting its net income. However, despite these challenges, Zebra's growth potential is not reflected in its current valuation. With America's manufacturing construction activity at historically high levels, driven by onshoring and government stimulus, it is expected that spending will eventually lead to supply chain investments and new equipment purchases. Furthermore, Zebra's strategic shift from a hardware-centric company to a solutions provider offers ample growth opportunities, particularly in labor optimization solutions. The company has a capable management team with a track record of driving growth organically and through acquisitions. Overall, patient investors may find Zebra Technologies to be an attractive opportunity, considering its business, management, growth prospects, challenges, potential disruptions, and valuation."

        "summary": "The article discusses the ongoing campaign for the \"Voice\" referendum in Australia, which has become a divisive issue. The referendum, set for October 14th, requires a majority of Australian voters in a majority of states to pass. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has tied his fate to the outcome, with a win bolstering his status within the party and a loss potentially leading to his slide into illegitimacy. The author argues that Albanese made a mistake by holding the referendum separately from elections, as legislating for \"The Voice\" during Labor's \"honeymoon\" period would have attracted less controversy. The campaign has driven a wedge between Australians and created an environment of anger, hate, and abuse. The author also raises concerns about the potential consequences of enshrining race into the constitution, citing Malaysia as an example where such policies led to a neo-feudal society and institutionalized corruption. The article concludes by suggesting that there could be a better way to address the issues faced by indigenous Australians."

        "summary": "Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is currently serving a jail sentence, may be granted a pardon in the future. There is speculation that the pardon could be granted sooner rather than later, in order to allow voters to forget about Najib's conviction before the next election. The power to grant a pardon lies with the Agong, the Malaysian monarch, who can act on it with or without the advice of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, has reportedly given his \"green light\" for the pardon. There are arguments in favor of a pardon for Najib, including the belief that he was not given the benefit of the doubt during his trial and that there may have been a miscarriage of justice. However, there are also those who oppose a pardon for Najib, including the media and the Bar Council, who have engaged in a \"Trial by Media\" against him. The decision to grant a pardon ultimately rests with the Agong, and there is no legal recourse against his decision."

        "summary": "Teacher absenteeism in government schools in Malaysia is a significant issue that negatively impacts students. A recent court case in Kota Kinabalu highlighted the problem, with a teacher being absent from class for seven months. The extent of the issue is difficult to measure due to deliberate cover-ups, falsification of records, and a culture of fear that prevents students from reporting absenteeism. Teacher absenteeism affects students' ability to progress in their education and perform well in exams, keeping them trapped in low-income social strata. It also hinders their ability to learn English, which is a compulsory subject for university admission. Teacher absenteeism can lead to mental health issues, loss of trust in adults, and a loss of hope for the future. It also degrades the quality of the workforce in the coming generation. The problem is a symptom of dissatisfaction within the teaching profession, with low motivation levels and some teachers engaging in other income-earning activities during school hours. The issue needs to be addressed before any other education reforms can be effective."

In addition to using defamation laws, lawyers are also attempting to extort cash payments from those accused of defaming their clients.

The article provides a list of lawyers who are questionable in their ethics and moral compass when it comes to using defamation laws.

The project involves monitoring warships and fishing vessels, as well as leveraging support from parties like Petronas and the Sarawak Coast Guard to track the movements of Chinese and Vietnamese vessels. In addition, hydrological data, mineral, and seismic maps are being developed in disputed areas.

The joint operations with the US are seen as a way to protect Malaysian sovereignty and are part of the US's containment strategy against Chinese activities in the South China Sea.

        "guid": "https://theovershoot.co/p/less-tax-evasion-a-profit-boom-and",
        "summary": "The U.S. national accounts measure economic activity through two aggregates: GDP (expenditure-based estimate) and GDI (income-based estimate). However, there is often a \"statistical discrepancy\" between the two, leading to contradictory answers about the state of the economy. Since 2021, there have been large swings in the discrepancy between GDP and GDI. The gap was initially due to GDP understating business investment and GDI overstating workers' wages. More recently, GDI has been falling sharply compared to GDP because of a 31% drop in American businesses' net interest payments. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) publishes comprehensive revisions every five years, which have resulted in both measures of economic output being revised up by nearly 2% as of 2023Q2. However, the gap between the income-based and expenditure-based estimates remains large. The revisions have been influenced by changes in the treatment of regulated investment companies, growth in corporate profits during the pandemic, new estimates of tax evasion, revisions in spending on imputed rent, and changes in investment spending. The discrepancy in net interest payments by businesses also persists."

        "summary": "Aramark is set to spin off its uniform rental and workplace supplies division, Vestis Corp, at the end of September. Vestis provides uniform rentals and workplace supplies to businesses, with total sales of $2.7 billion in 2022. The uniform rental market is estimated to be worth $10.3 billion, with Cintas as the clear leader. Vestis is targeting 5-7% sales growth and 18-20% EBITDA margins by 2028. The spin-off is expected to have a loaded 4x levered balance sheet and a discount to peers due to high leverage. The estimated equity value of Vestis is $7-8.50 per share. Aramark's remaining business, focused on food and facilities management, operates in a $540 billion market. The balance sheet is 4.7x levered, and the business is seen as a levered COVID recovery play. The estimated value of Aramark's remaining business is $25-30 per share, with potential additional value from seasonal cash generation and asset sales. Both Vestis and Aramark's remaining business will start with around 4x leverage and plan to reduce it over the next few years."

        "summary": "The world is experiencing exponential growth in the adoption of clean-energy technologies, particularly solar, batteries, and electric vehicles (EVs). Solar output has nearly doubled since 2019, with some countries generating over 10% of their electricity from solar. EV sales have increased from 2.2 million in 2019 to an estimated 14 million this year, and EVs could make up 1 in 5 new vehicles sold worldwide. The growth of these technologies has led to a surge in battery manufacturing, with the US and EU seeing significant increases in production. However, China remains the dominant player in solar manufacturing, accounting for a large share of global production. The US and EU are trying to catch up but still rely heavily on imports, particularly from China. Geopolitical competition for control over these industries is intensifying, leading to green trade wars and efforts to onshore manufacturing. The article highlights the importance of international cooperation and coordination to avoid underbuilding green energy technologies and to ensure a smooth transition to a clean energy future."

Second, it explores the increasing health inequality in America, particularly among those without college degrees, as evidenced by declining life expectancies. Third, it examines the rise of zero-sum thinking in the US, as shown by a survey that indicates younger Americans have a higher index of zero-sum thinking compared to older generations. Fourth, it emphasizes the challenges of obtaining accurate economic data, citing examples of historical GDP per capita estimates and discrepancies in energy price indices.

        "summary": "President Biden recently made history by joining striking UAW workers near Detroit, solidifying his image as a champion of the working class. This comes as part of a larger labor revival in the US, with major strikes happening across various industries. The labor revival has the support of the Biden Administration and the American people, as unions are more popular than they have been in decades. However, the UAW strike may face challenges due to the ongoing shift from internal combustion cars to electric vehicles in the auto industry. This shift will reduce the importance of traditional heavily unionized industry clusters like Detroit and transform the nature of auto manufacturing. The ability of US institutions, including car companies, the government, and labor, to adapt to these changes will determine whether union-friendly states can avoid a new version of the Rust Belt. Electric vehicles are expected to dominate the marketplace in the next couple of decades."

        "summary": "The article discusses the shortcomings of America's socialist movement and Bernie Sanders' campaign. The author criticizes the socialists for their obsession with power and factionalism, which led them to focus on attacking Democrats and progressives who weren't part of their faction. The author argues that Bernie and his supporters missed the opportunity to create a real grassroots movement and instead bungled it. However, the problems that fueled the socialist movement, such as expensive healthcare, inequality, high student debt, and climate change, still exist. The author proposes more realistic versions of four of Bernie's ideas: Medicare for All, a wealth tax, student debt cancellation, and the Green New Deal. For universal healthcare, the author suggests using a system like Japan's, which would address the high costs of American healthcare. The author also argues that the focus should be on reducing hidden healthcare costs rather than eliminating out-of-pocket costs. Overall, the author believes that while the socialist movement had its flaws, some of their ideas can be refined and implemented effectively to address the country's major issues."

        "summary": "Xi Jinping, the leader of China, is facing criticism for his handling of various issues, including the country's economic slowdown, diplomatic blunders, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Critics argue that Xi's personal objections to certain economic policies and his ideological preference for austerity have hindered efforts to stimulate China's economy. Additionally, Xi's growing paranoia and series of purges of his own officials have caused turmoil within China's leadership. Internationally, Xi's aggressive and bellicose approach has alienated neighboring countries and led to a negative perception of China. Furthermore, China's \"zero COVID\" policy and reliance on domestically produced vaccines have been met with challenges and have contributed to economic difficulties. Overall, there are concerns about Xi's competence as a leader and the impact of his decisions on China's future. However, given his consolidation of power and the lack of alternatives, it is unlikely that Xi will step down voluntarily."

        "guid": "https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-do-economists-get-paid-more-than",
        "summary": "Economists tend to make higher salaries than sociologists, and there are various reasons for this disparity. One explanation is the difference in supply and demand. Economists have fewer people interested in becoming economists compared to sociologists, which means that universities have to pay economists more to attract them. Additionally, economists have more outside options, such as working in the private sector as consultants or data scientists, which increases their bargaining power and allows them to command higher salaries. Another factor is the higher demand for economics classes from undergraduates, particularly business majors. Universities may be more desperate to hire economists to meet this demand, leading to higher salaries for economists. However, it is challenging to determine the true story behind the salary differential between economists and sociologists, as it requires empirical testing and matching theoretical models to data. Nonetheless, understanding market forces and social factors can shed light on the reasons behind the salary gap."

The list includes factors such as earnings growth, revenue growth, competitive advantage, and valuation. The author acknowledges the challenge of executing a quality growth strategy and plans to explore the topic further in future articles. The article also discusses a presentation by Baillie Gifford, which emphasized the importance of staying the course with growth stocks and focusing on the long term.

        "summary": "Transmedics, a medical technology company, has developed the Organ Care System (OCS), a machine that preserves organs for transplantation. The OCS replicates the conditions of the body and perfuses oxygenated blood, creating a better environment for organ preservation. While there is no strong clinical evidence that OCS-preserved organs have better outcomes than those preserved using traditional cold storage, cardiologists tend to prefer OCS-preserved organs. The OCS also broadens the potential pool of organ recipients by allowing transportation of organs to distant locations. Transmedics focuses on liver and heart transplants, which are growing markets with a significant gap between supply and demand. The company operates on a pay-per-use model, offering the OCS to hospitals as part of its National OCS Program. Transmedics faces competition from cold storage methods and other warm perfusion systems, but it enjoys a first-mover advantage and limited competition. Risks to the company include execution and the challenge of building a logistical aviation network. Despite these risks, Transmedics has a strong market position and potential for growth, with a projected enterprise value of $5 billion by 2028."

This highlights the importance of management in small companies and the misalignment of interests between insiders and outside investors. On the other hand, the author reflects on their investment in Wilh. Wilhelmsen Holding ASA, which traded at a significant discount to its asset value. Despite the lack of value-unlocking transactions, the company's underlying assets grew in value, resulting in a good return for shareholders. This emphasizes the importance of analyzing the growth potential of underlying assets rather than solely focusing on the discount to net asset value. The author also shares some interesting historical tidbits about Monarch Cement and reflects on the prevalence of prejudice in the early 20th century.

        "summary": "Conor Maguire, Founder and Editor of the Value Situations Newsletter, discusses his thesis on Marlowe plc, a provider of compliance software and services. Marlowe is a roll-up business that has been acquiring companies in the testing, inspection, certification (TIC) and governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) sectors. Maguire believes that Marlowe is undervalued and presents a good investment opportunity. He highlights the company's strong financial performance, with revenues and EBITDA meeting targets and showing good organic growth. He also mentions the potential for a sale of the TIC business, which could unlock significant value for shareholders. Maguire addresses the bear case, which focuses on the company's adjusted earnings and lack of cash flow. He argues that the adjustments are necessary for integration costs and that the cash flow profile of the business is solid. He also discusses the management incentives and the potential for capital allocation decisions. Overall, Maguire sees Marlowe as a cheap and fundamentally sound investment opportunity."

        "summary": "The Federal Reserve's rate hike campaign appears to be over, with the probability of further rate hikes diminishing quickly. Critics of direct air capture (DAC) technology raise valid concerns, but The Gregor Letter argues that we should invest in DAC regardless. The US government is making moves to support DAC, including announcing prize money and funding for demonstration projects. However, the missing element in current DAC discourse is the vision of how DAC would look in its optimal state, running on 100% clean energy. Driving an electric vehicle (EV) in any US state now creates less pollution than an internal combustion engine (ICE) car, according to Yale Climate Connections. This assessment is based on the fuel mix in each state's electricity grid. While this analysis only considers the pump-to-wheel accounting, which excludes upstream mining and CO2 emissions, EVs still outperform ICE vehicles in both pump-to-wheel and well-to-wheel accounting. The Gregor Letter has been presenting comprehensive well-to-wheel accountings for years, showing the superiority of EVs over ICE vehicles."

        "summary": "The world's energy system has seen minimal change in the past decade, with natural gas, hydro, and nuclear maintaining a stable global energy share. However, coal and oil have experienced significant declines in market share, with coal losing three percentage points and oil losing one and a half percentage points. Renewables, particularly wind and solar, have seen a significant increase in global energy share, gaining nearly six percentage points. The challenge in decarbonization lies in cleaning up transportation and industrial processes, which require more complex solutions than cleaning up power grids. The stagnation of global nuclear power over the past 20 years is seen as a missed opportunity to further reduce the market share of natural gas. The article emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to decarbonization that includes not only wind, solar, and batteries but also electrification of vehicles and the development of nuclear power."

        "summary": "As winter approaches, the question of whether to reinstate mandatory masking in hospitals and long-term care facilities arises. The scientific evidence supports the case for reinstating masks in these settings. In-hospital respiratory infections, including those acquired during the fall and winter, have been a problem for decades. Community transmission increases the risk of hospital transmission. Healthcare workers often come to work sick due to high workload burden and a lack of paid sick time. Masks have been shown to be effective in reducing infections, especially in hospitals. However, there are arguments against mandatory masks, such as the negative impact on healthcare workers and the question of preventability of in-hospital respiratory infections. The decision on whether to reinstate masks ultimately depends on values. Possible options include keeping mandatory masking throughout the year, implementing universal masking during a specific window of time, or requiring masks in high-risk units. It is likely that hospitals and long-term care facilities will return to mandatory masking soon. Masks are a low-cost and minimally invasive intervention that can help protect high-risk individuals during the fall and winter season."

        "guid": "https://www.asiasentinel.com/p/thailand-elite-crunch-thaksin-retain-power",
        "summary": "Thailand's recent general election saw a record 75 percent voter turnout, with the public demanding radical reform of governance. The Move Forward Party (MFP) gained popularity by pledging to review the monarch's privileges and revise or abolish the l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law. However, the ruling elite outplayed the MFP by squeezing former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to concede in return for a royal pardon that reduced his prison sentence. This split the opposition and forced Thaksin and his party to ally with the military parties to form the new government. The Constitutional Court played a role in disqualifying MFP leader Pita Limjaroenrat, who had inherited shares in a defunct TV company, breaching election regulations. Thaksin's return was carefully orchestrated, with his pardon leading to the formation of a government that goes against the reform promises of the opposition party. The simmering resentment among voters could lead to protests, as they are aware of ruling class misdeeds and royal greed. The Constitutional Court, which has dissolved opposition parties and nullified elections in the past, is seen as unfit for its purpose. King Maha Vajiralongkorn's unconventional behavior and control over the Crown Property Bureau have also caused discontent among student protestors."

        "summary": "Vietnamese syndicates are heavily involved in the illegal trade of elephant ivory, rhinoceros horn, pangolin scales, and other wildlife products, according to an undercover investigation by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). The investigation reveals the intricate routes used to transport ivory and rhino horn from African ports to Malaysia, Laos, and finally Vietnam. The report highlights the role of Malaysian and Laotian transport hubs and the widespread corruption in these countries. The EIA report also provides detailed profiles of key syndicate members, including Phan Chi, who operates with impunity and has close relations with high-level officials in Africa and Vietnam. The report emphasizes the need for action by African, Asian, and American authorities to combat these syndicates and protect Africa's wildlife from extinction. The recent arrest and imprisonment of Teo Boon Ching, a key player in the syndicate, offers hope for dismantling these criminal networks."

        "summary": "The current crisis between Canada and India could have been avoided through careful diplomacy and compromise. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of being involved in the assassination of a Sikh separatist in Vancouver, which India has dismissed as absurd and politically motivated. Trudeau's accusation has caused a furor and raised concerns about the Khalistan movement, which seeks independence for the Indian state of Punjab. The Sikh diaspora in Canada is politically significant, and Trudeau's governing coalition relies on the support of the Sikh-led New Democratic Party. The dispute between Canada and India has the potential to give the Khalistan cause international credibility, despite there being no significant Sikh minority in Punjab seeking independence. The involvement of India in the alleged assassination remains unclear, and mediation efforts by President Biden and his officials are underway to resolve the impasse."

This move has raised concerns about escalating tensions between the Philippines and China in the South China Sea. The removal of the barrier has been criticized by some prominent Filipino opinion influencers who believe it undermines the country's sovereignty and territorial claims.

However, these assurances have been met with skepticism, as China's actions in the South China Sea have been aggressive and assertive. The South China Sea is a highly contested area, with multiple countries, including China, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia, claiming sovereignty over various islands and waters. The tensions in the region have escalated in recent years, with China building military installations on artificial islands and conducting naval exercises. The international community, including the United States, has called for a peaceful resolution to the disputes and for the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea to be upheld."

Marcos promised to support farmers and promote farming, but his actions have been criticized as inadequate \"band-aid treatments.\" The main issue is the shrinking harvest area in the Philippines, which has led to increased imports of rice and other agricultural products. Marcos has been urged to recognize this problem and take decisive action. Critics also point out that Marcos lacks effective management skills and fails to consult with advisers on important decisions. They argue that his father, former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr., understood the importance of rice as a political commodity and ensured its supply. Suggestions have been made to establish a system that allows farmers to store their harvests in government warehouses and sell directly to consumers with logistical support. The article suggests that Marcos could learn from India's success in achieving food self-sufficiency and becoming a major rice exporter."

        "summary": "India and Canada are engaged in a diplomatic spat after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of being involved in the death of Sikh Canadian leader Hardeep Nijjar. India has retaliated by expelling the Canadian intelligence chief in Delhi and suspending all visas to India. The tension between the two countries may take years to repair, and trust may not be fully restored. India believes that the Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) organization in Canada, which Nijjar was associated with, is backed by Pakistan and aims to undermine India's reputation. The suspension of visas is the latest measure taken by India to defend itself against the accusation of killing Nijjar. The Canadian government's allegations are seen by India as politically driven. The diplomatic dispute has also highlighted the lack of Canadian interest in bringing those responsible for the 1985 Air India bombing to justice. The spat may have unintended consequences for Trudeau, as it could strengthen the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India. India is counting on the undermining of Trudeau within the Western alliance."

        "summary": "Luxury brands focus on crafting an experience and curating an image rather than directly selling products. Advertising is used for storytelling and brand building, not for promoting sales. Luxury brands target a select audience and aim to deepen the relationship with true enthusiasts. They guide customers through their brand universe and educate them about their unique codes and language. Luxury brands maintain exclusivity by shielding core clients from outsiders and communicating messages that are heard by those who will never buy the product. While celebrities can bring attention, luxury brands avoid aligning too closely with them to maintain their intrinsic value. Engaging with the arts is a strategic alignment that speaks to those who appreciate both the arts and the brand. In terms of organizational strategy, luxury brands do not relocate their factories, avoid external consultants, resist group synergies, and prioritize adding value over cost-cutting. In the digital age, luxury brands balance the benefits of global reach with the need to maintain their unique brand essence. Very few companies rigorously adhere to all the principles of luxury, and the definition of luxury can vary. Authentic luxury is often about the journey, the wait, and the exclusivity of the acquisition."

        "summary": "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the Bank of England have decided to keep interest rates unchanged. This led to a slight drop in gold and silver prices, but silver has shown more resilience. The low open interest on Comex suggests that the downside for silver is limited. However, the strong dollar and rising bond yields pose a challenge for precious metals. The charts for 10-year bund and JGB yields indicate that they are likely to rise significantly. The global economy is contracting, and borrowers are facing difficulties due to higher interest rates. Hedge funds have traditionally believed that high interest rates are negative for gold, but there is a transition towards fear of the economic and monetary outlook for fiat currencies. The dollar has been strong recently due to these fears, but history has shown that in times of crisis, there is often an initial flight to the safety of the dollar. However, higher interest rates could ultimately crash the dollar, making gold an attractive investment."

These studies focus on identifying vaccine-hesitant groups, statistics on these populations, and strategies to overcome vaccine hesitancy through propaganda, censorship, the law, and behavioral control. The government, along with organizations like the WHO and UNICEF, has spent billions of dollars to manipulate beliefs and eliminate informed consent. The government-funded \"We Can Do This\" campaign used a mix of digital, television, print, radio, and out-of-home channels to increase vaccine confidence and uptake. The campaign utilized propaganda and repetitive messaging to influence people's decision to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The success of this campaign has shown that governments will likely increase their use of propaganda, censorship, and behavioral modification tools in future health crises. The public is becoming more skeptical and untrusting, which poses a challenge for the administrative state. However, the fight against these tactics will likely be bigger next time."

The author argues that AI has the potential to disrupt critical thinking itself, which poses a new threat to a free society that relies on independent thinkers. On the one hand, AI may diminish critical thinking by becoming a crutch for students. On the other hand, it may also elevate critical thinking by providing new opportunities for analysis and understanding. The author suggests that in the future, human critical thinking may need to focus on questioning the biases of AI and its developers. Ultimately, the hope is that AI can be used as a tool for the betterment of society, promoting freedom and responsibility."

The Act empowers the Commission to pressure platforms to curb \"hate speech,\" \"disinformation,\" and threats to \"civic discourse,\" which are vague and subjective categories. The legislation gives the Commission discretionary powers to oversee content moderation policies, effectively holding freedom of speech hostage to the ideological preferences of unelected officials. The Act also creates \"trusted flaggers\" who can report illegal content, and platforms are required to prioritize their reports. Non-compliance with the Act can result in fines of up to 6% of a platform's annual global turnover. The Act also requires platforms to undertake risk mitigation assessments and periodic audits, giving the Commission the power to impose multi-billion dollar fines for non-compliance. The Act places enormous power and discretion in the hands of the unelected European Commission, jeopardizing free speech and allowing the Commission to advance its favored political narrative."

In between these extremes are the \"soft right\" and \"soft left\" who have differing levels of concern for the climate crisis.

This retreat is driven by concerns about the cost and impact on standard of living. Similar retrenchments have been observed in Sweden and Canada, and there is a rightward tilt in German politics.

They argue that long-short hedge funds have performed poorly since 2008 because they typically do the opposite. The author also reflects on their past mistakes of going bearish in 2016 and 2019, emphasizing that the market is now more political than macro. They mention their top short position in TLT, which continues to attract capital despite its poor performance. The article concludes by mentioning that the strategy of being long S&P 500 futures and short individual stocks has been successful in 2023, and the author explores one short theme that has worked and its potential future prospects."

        "summary": "The article discusses the concept of empires and their influence on geopolitics. It compares the dominance of the British Empire in the past to the current dominance of the US military. The author suggests that the decline of the US Empire could lead to significant changes in anti-monopoly actions and tax policies. The article also explores the idea of three competing empires in the Eurasian megacontinent: European, Islamic, and Chinese (or Christian, Islamic, and Confucian). It argues that conflicts in the world can be categorized as battles between empires or battles within empires. The rise of China is seen as reopening old fissures of empire and leading to a more nationalist and religious aspect in politics. The article predicts a future geopolitical battle between the European, Islamic, Confucian, and Hindu worlds. It suggests that nationalism and religion will become more important in geopolitics, and the rise of a Hindu empire in India will have significant implications. The article concludes by stating that religion and nationalism are the geopolitical tectonic plates of the world, and India's role in this new plate will likely lead to a geopolitical earthquake."

Instead, they need to focus on their core product offerings and find opportunities to launch new, innovative, and risky products with a better user experience. The article emphasizes that this small window of opportunity will not last long, as market sentiment shifts back to positive, so early-stage startups need to act quickly to capture a critical mass of users.

Unlike employees in the institutional segment of the industry, financial advisors have been able to command a stable or increasing share of revenue. They are paid an explicit share of the revenue they bring in, which has led to their ability to negotiate higher compensation and even sign-on bonuses. The individualized nature of the business creates challenges for large firms, as financial advisors can build up autonomy and take clients with them when they switch firms. The article also discusses the history of regulations and agreements regarding client poaching and compensation. Despite the challenges, wealth management is considered attractive due to its lower capital intensity and stability compared to the institutional securities business."

The sudden change in Treasury rates could have repercussions in areas such as bank lending and the housing market. The forced liquidations by investors who were still holding onto US Treasuries have led to steep losses and may impact lending and housing starts. It is important to closely monitor these areas for any negative effects from the Treasury crash. While current economic data still points to higher nominal and real growth, the crash in long-term US Treasuries needs to be closely watched for any potential consequences on the current growth trajectory. In terms of market outlook, oversold conditions may lead to a short-term equity bounce, but the weight of the Treasury implosion is likely to have a lasting impact. The author plans to re-engage in US value when market stress is high enough to provide a margin of safety.

        "summary": "The fate of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), the world's largest exchange-traded fund (ETF), lies in the hands of eleven ordinary people. This is due to a quirk in the legal structure used to set up the fund, which dictates that it will terminate 20 years after the death of the last survivor of the eleven individuals named in the trust agreement. The fund, launched in 1993, has amassed $400 billion in assets under management. ETFs were initially met with resistance from asset managers, but their popularity grew as they offered passive, liquid, indexed funds at a low cost. The SPY was the catalyst for an explosion in ETF creation and adoption. Over the years, ETFs expanded to offer exposure to various asset classes and themes. The SPY's termination is unlikely to impact anyone in the near future, and there may be a transition process in place when the time comes. The story of the SPY's creation is an arcane piece of historical stock market trivia."

        "summary": "The lymphatic system is often overlooked in modern medicine, despite its important role in detoxification. Detoxification refers to the process of eliminating harmful substances and waste products from the body. While the liver is commonly associated with detoxification, other organs such as the kidneys, stomach, gallbladder, pancreas, and bowels also play a role. The lymphatic system, which runs alongside the circulatory system, is responsible for transporting fluid and waste products back into circulation. Maintaining a healthy lymphatic system is crucial for overall health. To promote effective lymphatic drainage, it is important to move the body regularly. Techniques such as lymphatic breathing, lymphatic massage, lymphatic stretching, and lymphatic pumping can also help improve lymphatic flow. These techniques can be done at home or with the assistance of trained professionals. Improving lymphatic flow can benefit conditions such as edema and can be especially important after surgery. Incorporating these techniques into a daily routine and staying active can support optimal lymphatic drainage and overall detoxification."

        "summary": "The latest Weekly S&P500 #ChartStorm provides insights and conclusions from various charts. The S&P 500 closed down 4.9% in September, marking its second monthly decline in a row. Financial conditions have tightened significantly, but there has been an initial climax in these moves. Medium-term bull market signals from margin debt and sentiment remain intact. The equity risk premium suggests that cash may outperform equities over the next three years. UK railway stocks in the 1800s serve as a reminder that technological revolutions aren't always kind to investors. Technically, the market looks primed for a rebound, but the sharp tightening of financial conditions and bigger picture technical deterioration suggest skepticism on the sustainability of any short-term bounce. The article also discusses basing breadth, correction drivers, seasonal shifts, bull market signals, rates and valuations, and the performance of global vs US equities. It concludes with a reminder that winning technology does not always translate to winning investments, using the example of British railway stocks in the 1800s."

        "summary": "The Weekly S&P500 #ChartStorm provides insights and conclusions from various charts. Key takeaways include indicators showing oversold conditions and approaching support levels, but financial conditions tightening remains a concern. Seasonally, some weakness is expected, and medium-term macro downside signals are mounting. The 60/40 portfolio is struggling due to low yields and high valuation scores. Investors looking to buy the dip should exercise patience as the correction runs its course. Trigger points to watch include the 4300 zone, peak yields, the US dollar, and energy prices. Micro cap stocks breaking support could signal bearish risks. The last interest rate hike of the cycle historically leads to stock rallies, but a recession could reverse this trend. The rate of change in job openings suggests softening, adding to macro downside risks. Interest expense is increasing, putting pressure on earnings. Bond yields now offer almost 3x the yield income of stocks. The 60/40 portfolio's combined yield remains low, and valuation indicators for stocks and bonds are slightly expensive."

The author uses a blended PE ratio, which combines the PE10, trailing PE, and forward PE, to analyze the valuations. The article suggests that China is currently undervalued compared to its historical levels and compared to the USA. The author acknowledges the risks associated with investing in China, such as geopolitical risk and regulatory risk, but argues that these risks are already priced into the low valuations. The article concludes that valuation indicators can be seen as both sentiment indicators and fundamental indicators, and currently, they indicate that investors are confident in the USA and pessimistic about China."

They argue that the assumption of a contest for the middle ground between two normal political parties is fundamentally wrong. The author concludes by mentioning the existence of the 2025 Project, which aims to establish a permanent right-wing dictatorship, as evidence of where the polarization is truly coming from."

        "summary": "Chemical company Croda's shares have fallen 15% since June, reaching their lowest point since May 2020. However, Librarian Capital believes that the shares have limited downside and potential for significant upside. The company's 2023 earnings are expected to be a cyclical low due to post-COVID customer de-stocking and the shrinkage of vaccine-related sales. Croda's full H1 2023 results have shown some positive signs, with Consumer Care volumes starting to improve and the weakening of the UK Pound providing a tailwind. Near-term sales remain uncertain, but the company's long-term bull case includes a rebound in EPS in 2024 and mid-to-high single-digit growth. Additionally, there is a possibility of Croda being acquired by a strategic buyer at a significant premium. Librarian Capital reiterates its Buy rating on Croda, with a base case of 58% upside by the end of 2026."

The company's shares have fallen 18% year-to-date, and its adjusted EBIT rebounded 41% in the first half of the year. Maintenance sales are growing steadily, and modernization sales are picking up pace. Despite a weak Chinese construction market, Kone is expected to achieve mid-single-digit EPS growth. The company's guidance for 2023 implies a large recovery in adjusted EBIT. However, there has been a decline in new equipment orders, particularly in China. Nevertheless, Kone's exposure to China has decreased, and maintenance sales in the country are growing rapidly. The stock is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 22.8x, and it is expected to return 47% by the end of 2026. The upside potential would be even greater if there is a rebound in the Chinese property sector. Overall, Kone is considered an attractive investment opportunity."

        "summary": "A study by researchers from Stanford and New York University found that, on average, 58% of pre-merger equity in Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) goes into servicing the SPAC, leaving only $4.2 for the target company for acquisition. Most of these costs are borne by SPAC shareholders. SPACs also create dysfunctional incentives for sponsors, who can make significant profits even if the SPAC underperforms. The overall costs incurred by SPACs can vary based on the quality of sponsors. The biggest flaw of SPACs is that sponsors only get rewarded if a merger is completed, creating a conflict of interest. Research shows that sponsors can do well even if SPAC investors do poorly. The article highlights Chamath Palihapitiya as an example, whose company made $750 million through SPACs while the actual stock performance was not as impressive. The current incentive structure forces sponsors to make deals, and the outcome is consistent with their incentives."

The example of entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, who bought an NFT of an ape wearing an orange hat for $5.9 million only to see it become worthless two years later, illustrates this trend. The research suggests that the NFT market is highly unpredictable and caution should be exercised when investing in these digital assets."

To restore confidence and enhance its appeal as a global financial center, Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu must be bold and creative in his action plan. One major issue that needs to be addressed is the housing problem, with many people still living in cramped conditions. Hong Kong can learn from Beijing's approach to eradicating poverty, where personal responsibility and mobilization were key. Lee should adopt a whole-of-government approach and develop a new housing policy and holistic plan to help the city's poor. The argument that a rise in public housing supply would depress private home prices is tired and hollow, as seen in Singapore's successful model. Additionally, Hong Kong must do more to explain the beauty of \"two systems\" to the outside world and use its influence to lobby the central government to rethink policies that directly impact the city."

The second lesson discusses two philosophical razors: Hanlon's Razor and Occam's Razor. Hanlon's Razor advises giving people the benefit of the doubt and not assuming malice when their actions are objectionable. Occam's Razor suggests defaulting to simple explanations when they adequately describe a situation. The author explains that both razors can coexist but emphasizes the need to adapt our views when a pattern of behavior indicates malice. The third lesson explores the futility of hatred and the potential damage it can cause. The author suggests striving for indifference instead of descending into hatred and recommends disassociating from toxic people and situations. The author concludes by highlighting the importance of experience and sharing these lessons with others."

        "summary": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized the field of protein structure prediction, allowing scientists to determine the 3D structure of proteins in a matter of minutes. The breakthrough came with the introduction of AlphaFold, an AI system developed by DeepMind, which achieved high accuracy in predicting protein structures. AlphaFold2, based on a transformer model, surpassed its predecessor in accuracy and was widely recognized by the scientific community. The annual Albert Lasker Foundation Basic Medical Research Award was recently awarded to AlphaFold for its significant contributions. The use of AI in protein structure prediction has led to breakthroughs in various areas of life science, including the design of molecular syringes for targeted drug delivery, the cracking of the 3D structure of the nuclear pore complex, and the design of complex protein structures. However, it is important to note that AI models like AlphaFold are not perfect and have limitations in certain areas. Nevertheless, transformer models have shown their potential in transforming various fields beyond protein prediction, such as predicting missense mutations, RNA structure, and gene networks. The impact of transformer AI models in life science has been profound and may even warrant future recognition, such as a Nobel Prize."

        "summary": "The United States Department of Justice has filed a notice of appeal on behalf of the FDA in a long-running dispute over the regulation of premium cigars. In July 2022, a court ruled that the FDA's decision to regulate premium cigars was arbitrary and capricious because it failed to consider relevant data on their use and health effects. The FDA's decision to appeal the ruling is puzzling, considering that premium cigars make up a small fraction of tobacco products in the US and have low underage usage. If the appeal is successful, the status quo will be maintained, with premium cigars remaining under FDA regulation. However, if the appeal fails, new premium handmade cigar products will no longer be bound by regulatory requirements, allowing for greater variety and competition. Scandinavian Tobacco Group (STG), a major player in the premium cigar industry, stands to benefit from both outcomes. If the appeal succeeds, STG's exceptional portfolio of products will continue to be protected from new competition. If the appeal fails, STG can leverage its expertise and infrastructure to introduce innovative blends and expand its offerings, catering to a wider range of consumer preferences."

It allowed players to explore an open world with no main storyline and no defined class archetypes, giving them the freedom to mix and match skills. The game also had a complex economy, with players taking on roles as crafters to meet the demand for weapons and supplies. Ultima Online's development team attempted to create a balanced ecological system within the game, but players quickly disrupted it by killing all the animals for their resources. This taught the team a valuable lesson about the unpredictability of player behavior and the need for real-world testing.

        "guid": "https://www.karlstack.com/p/fraud-at-georgetown-finance-shakes",
        "summary": "The article discusses a scandal in the corporate bond literature, where a paper published in the Journal of Financial Economics (JFE) is found to have major errors and potential fraud. The paper, authored by Jennie Bai, Turan Bali, and Quan Wen, contains a lead-lag error and surreptitious winsorization, which distort the results. The errors were exposed by another group of researchers, Dickerson, Mueller, and Robotti, who published a paper in JFE highlighting the mistakes in the original paper. The JFE retracted the fraudulent paper and published the correct factors. However, the extent of the impact of this scandal is significant, as many published and working papers have relied on the fraudulent factors, raising questions about the validity of a vast body of academic work. The response from Georgetown, where the authors are professors, and the academic community at large has been criticized for lack of transparency and action. The article calls for further investigation and accountability to restore the integrity of academic research in finance."

        "summary": "Thousands of economists will have to return to Twitter or find a new platform as the Mastodon server, a popular alternative to Twitter, is being shut down. The reason for the shutdown is believed to be a mass-doxxing campaign and an alleged IP honeytrap blackmail scheme. The evidence of this scheme is expected to be destroyed, unless it is subpoenaed. The shutdown of the Mastodon server will force economists to find alternative platforms for communication and networking."

        "summary": "Three professors from Yale University, Dr. Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham, Dr. Florian Ederer, and Dr. Kyle Jensen, hacked the website econjobrumors.com and stole millions of IP addresses. The hack is considered unethical and illegal, as there was a reasonable expectation of privacy for users of the site. The professors claim to be \"white hat hackers,\" but their actions are seen as gray-hat or even black-hat hacking. The owner of econjobrumors.com and economist Dr. Tyler Cowen agree that the hack took place. The author of the article argues that the professors should be arrested and criminally charged, and lawsuits should be brought against Yale. The author also raises concerns about the professors' ownership of the EconTwitter mastodon server and the potential for further legal liability. The hack has already caused psychological distress to some individuals, and there are worries about the safety of Chinese and Turkish dissidents who posted criticism on the site. The author questions why the Yale Institutional Review Board did not respond to complaints and requests for human subjects paperwork."

He has requested the human subjects paperwork from the study's authors but has been refused. Wimble believes there are violations of the Nuremberg Code in the study. He also accuses Florian Ederer, a professor at Boston University and one of the authors, of being a coward. Wimble, who has experienced a tenure denial and a suicide attempt, credits the EJMR community for helping him recover. He plans to move back to Michigan to be with his family and heal his daughter. Wimble criticizes the use of tax dollars for the study and suggests that some of the authors may have national security clearances."

        "summary": "A micro-cap company with a market capitalization of less than $100 million is showing strong growth potential. The company has achieved industry-leading same-store sales growth in its key brand, with core brand system revenue increasing by 16% in fiscal year 2023 compared to the previous year. The CEO has a successful track record of execution, and the company has seen a 28% year-over-year increase in EBITDA and operating income when adjusted for PPP forgiveness in 2022. Additionally, the company has repurchased 20% of its outstanding shares and has a cash reserve equal to approximately 20% of its market cap, with zero debt. The management is focusing on the core business, improving unit economics through low-cost product innovation, and restarting growth with new store openings. If the bullish hypothesis is correct, the company has the potential to be a substantial multibagger, with a 10X increase in value over the long term. However, investors should consider the limited liquidity and risk/volatility associated with investing in sub $100 million market cap companies."

It argues that Western leaders have failed to balance the needs of the majority with the desires of a vocal minority. The article highlights the declining capital in developed markets and questions whether emerging markets will share the burden of energy transition. It also mentions the reliance on fossil fuels and the potential consequences of neglecting green energy. The author suggests that the market will eventually expose faulty notions and that energy security requires long-term capital investment. The article concludes by stating that this is just the beginning and implies that the current approach to climate change may not be sustainable."

Additionally, the article mentions the possibility of energy prices increasing due to geopolitical factors. The author suggests that inflation may not settle around the 2% level and that rates are creeping higher due to the need for investors to absorb government debt. The article concludes that if interest rates continue to rise, asset prices may need to adjust accordingly."

        "summary": "A recent study by Bryan Hardy and Sonya Zhu examines changes in bank deposit funding following a regional bank panic earlier this year. The study reveals that non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) substituted for the non-financial sector as providers of deposit funding to internationally active banks in the first quarter of 2023. This shift was globally modest but concentrated in a few countries. Additionally, deposits in the United States shifted to money market funds, which led to increased dollar lending to banks outside the United States. The study also highlights that the growth in deposit funding in major jurisdictions slowed down, with negative year-on-year growth in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. The authors suggest that these changes in deposit funding can have implications for financial stability."

        "guid": "https://moneyinsideout.exantedata.com/p/china-after-the-dividend",
        "summary": "China's demographic dividend, which fueled economic growth from the 1990s to 2010, has come to an end, and the country now faces the risk of a reverse demographic dividend. The working-age population is set to decline, while the population aged 65 and over will more than double by 2055. The decline in China's birth rate, which reached a new low in 2022, is contributing to this demographic challenge. However, a lower birth rate in the short term can have a positive impact on the economy by reducing the dependency ratio. China's innovation and productivity, as well as its society and governance, are the other two pillars of wealth creation that can counteract the demographic disadvantage. China has made significant progress in innovation, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence, and has invested heavily in infrastructure. However, there are concerns about the efficiency of converting innovation into wealth due to regulatory uncertainties and recent governance decisions. China's recent foreign policy and military buildup have also strained its relationships with neighboring countries and its most important trading partner, the United States. These factors have created uncertainty for China's economic future and foreign investors."

        "summary": "China's push for innovation through subsidies for patents has resulted in an explosion of low-quality patents, hindering the country's overall innovation and productivity growth. President Xi Jinping's revival of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and increased control over private companies further dampens China's economic potential. SOEs have lower returns on assets compared to private firms, and their performance continues to decline. The shift in investment towards SOEs limits the growth of more productive private companies. Xi's actions also reduce the efficiency of private firms, as their returns on assets are shrinking. The CCP's increasing influence in private companies and the integration of Party leadership into corporate governance further hinder the dynamism of the private sector. This trend is particularly concerning in provinces where SOEs play a larger role in the economy. Overall, Xi's policies undermine China's growth potential and living standards, as the country's investment remains inefficient and the trade-off between growth and living standards worsens."
